The story that caught my eye this week was not the stock market and tariffs… it was silicon photonics.

Assume every cloud service provider is simultaneously buying every GPU they can while also accelerating their own custom silicon production. This buys time for what comes next.

What comes next are the innovations in silicon photonics that will fundamentally alter these current assumptions. 

Silicon photonics will change existing AI workload architectural designs that would not otherwise be able to satisfy exponential growth in AI workloads in the years to come —  silicon photonics is what’s needed next.
