<p>The story that caught my eye this week was not the stock market and tariffs… it was silicon photonics.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250401/p16#a250401p16">https://www.techmeme.com/250401/p16#a250401p16</a></p><p>Assume every cloud service provider is simultaneously buying every GPU they can while also accelerating their own custom silicon production. This buys time for what comes next.</p><p>What comes next are the innovations in silicon photonics that will fundamentally alter these current assumptions. </p><p>Silicon photonics will change existing AI workload architectural designs that would not otherwise be able to satisfy exponential growth in AI workloads in the years to come —  silicon photonics is what’s needed next.</p>
