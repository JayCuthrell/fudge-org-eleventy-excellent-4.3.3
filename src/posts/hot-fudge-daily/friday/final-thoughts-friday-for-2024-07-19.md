# ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-07-19

Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.

*(The* [*elephant in the room is blue*](https://www.techmeme.com/240719/p2#a240719p2) *and it is a Friday when I write this update. So, I’ll update that topic in 🗞️ Sneak Peak Saturday.)*

I’ve committed to four events for the remainder of this year. I’ve also submitted a final version of a panel to PanelPicker for SXSW 2025 voting but I won’t be speaking on a panel but might submit a solo talk — maybe.

- [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) in Silicon Valley September 11-12, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
- [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/) in Portland October 2-4, 2024
- [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) in Silicon Valley October 23-24, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
- [All Things Open](https://2024.allthingsopen.org/) in Raleigh October 27-29, 2024 for [CLS](https://allthingsopen.org/events/community-leadership-summit-cls-2)
- [SXSW](https://sxsw.com/) in Austin March 7 - 15, 2025

This week, I continued the [Hot Fudge Daily](https://fudge.org/) digest posted in [🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday](https://fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-07-07/) as “free” weekly content.

Next month, [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) Google Adsense goes live. Again, there will not be any annoying “please turn off your ad blocker” messages.

When I considered flattening [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) newsletter via Buttondown it also occurred to me that I could write another newsletter too — possibly related to [unicornjockeys.com](http://unicornjockeys.com) or [unicornjockey.com](http://unicornjockey.com) domains. However, it will need to be a deep niche and make a bigger splash to attract a following.

As [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) will be going through major revisions, this is a good time to think about changes. Again, we shall see.

Mastodon updates last week enabled a slightly different route for default.

So simple.

I think Buttondown supports code tags.

$ git diff -- app/controllers/auth/sessions\_controller.rb

def home\_paths(resource)- paths = [about\_path, '/explore']+ paths = [about\_path, '/about']

paths << short\_account\_path(username: resource.account) if single\_user\_mode? && resource.is\_a?(User)

The result is /about vs. /explore which makes more sense for a single-user self-hosted instance.

I’ve been thinking more about using [qthrul.com](http://qthrul.com) aka QTHRUL CORP as a holding. That would be a nice way to anchor all my other websites — including [cuthrell.com](http://cuthrell.com), [jaycuthrell.com](https://jaycuthrell.com/), [cuthrell.consulting](http://cuthrell.consulting), and maybe even [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) too.
