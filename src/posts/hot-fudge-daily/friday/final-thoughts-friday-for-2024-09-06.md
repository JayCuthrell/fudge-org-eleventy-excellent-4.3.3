<p>As a reminder, I’ve committed to four events for the remainder of this year.</p><ol><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/">AI Field Day 5</a> in Silicon Valley September 9-13, 2024 for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/events/">Tech Field Day</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://monktoberfest.com/">Monktoberfest</a> in Portland October 1-4, 2024</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/">Cloud Field Day 21</a> in Silicon Valley October 23-25, 2024 for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/events/">Tech Field Day</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://2024.allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a> in Raleigh October 27-29, 2024 for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://allthingsopen.org/events/community-leadership-summit-cls-2">CLS</a></p></li></ol><p>Once again, the week in review is about being thankful for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://cuthrell.consulting/services/">new and ongoing client work</a>, catching up with folks I haven’t spoken to for years, and meeting new folks. Gym and hiking continues as I plan to reach personal goals in a list of non-technology projects.</p><p>Switching gears back to technology, the bigger tech stories this week seemed to be BGP, Internet Archive, Salesforce + Own(Backup), and YouTube/Google. My thinking is this:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240903/p33#a240903p33">https://www.techmeme.com/240903/p33#a240903p33</a></p><p>The thing about BGP and this coverage is that years have passed since the last time this was considered a big deal. By that, I mean the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/09/a-project-aims-to-help-isps-to-mind-their-routing-security-manners/">Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) published metrics</a> are reaching the 5 years old mark and even got a footnote in the PDF from the White House.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240904/p38#a240904p38">https://www.techmeme.com/240904/p38#a240904p38</a></p><p>Some pundits have called this the two tier system of justice where it is IA doing something wonderful for humanity vs. well funded “techbro” AI training on anything it wants and asking for forgiveness later. My takeaway is that if IA gets this kind of treatment, the various purveyors of GenAI/LLM training using published materials better save some of that funding, get lawyered up — and quickly, and get ready for the pain train of precedent.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240905/p37#a240905p37">https://www.techmeme.com/240905/p37#a240905p37</a></p><p>Not a lot of folks may realize this, but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2023/introducing-salesforce-backup-your-datas-safety-net">Salesforce never had their own native way of doing back up and recovery until very recently</a>. That's right! Previously, it was only third-party companies and managed service providers that dealt with how to backup, protect, and recover Salesforce data. Many of these providers have expanded or started in other SaaS data management and data protection services. My takeaway is that Salesforce now has, arguably, one of the best of these third-party manage service providers that was and is vastly more successful with Salesforce customers than the native <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.salesforce.com/platform/data-backup-recovery/">Salesforce Backup and recovery service</a> it launched a year ago. As for Own customers using Own for other SaaS backup and recovery related services… (i.e. possible Salesforce wallet share/shift “competitors” like ServiceNow and Microsoft…) well, that might be another story or possibly a carve out to be determined.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240906/p13#a240906p13">https://www.techmeme.com/240906/p13#a240906p13</a></p><p>YouTube has truly amazing content on the one hand and on the other it often seems become a place where you can look up a tame benign topic.. and the feed algorithm will look at the most banal heuristic like an IP address to flood you with awful suggestion published by some not so nice people. So, this is clearly a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shocking</a> thing that nobody paying attention was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shocked</a> to see confirmed.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240906/p22#a240906p22">https://www.techmeme.com/240906/p22#a240906p22</a></p><p>Speaking of being <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shocked</a>, it is probably not <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shocking</a> that Google monopoly ruling remedies can has been kicked down the road for another year from now.</p>
