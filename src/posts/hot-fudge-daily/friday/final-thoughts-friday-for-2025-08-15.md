I believe the biggest story this week was the reported deal that would require a ðŸ‘€ 15% *(originally 20% depending on the news source)* ðŸ‘€ cut of revenue that would be paid directly to... a government. In this instance, the US government and two companies; NVIDIA and AMD.

Of course, allegations, actions, and historical instances of pay-to-play is not a new thing. For such a young country, [100 years of US history goes by](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/senate-stories/one-hundred-years-since-teapot-dome.htm) in the blink of an eye. So, if *"data is the new oil"* holds true, the future of our AI value chain might rhyme with history.
