As of this update, my delegate duties at [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/) are done but my notes will be published in the coming days / weeks. Over three days, I and fellow delegates took in updates from Keysight, Integrail, Cisco, Vmware, Elastic, Arista, and Enfabrica *as well as* a Delegate Ignite Talk series and Delegate Roundtable!

> I would like to give a HUGE shout out to the team that makes Tech Field Day possible and to Futurum Group as well the sponsoring companies for making the event possible. 🙏 🙏 🙏

What’s next?

1. [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/) in Portland October 1-4, 2024
2. [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) in Silicon Valley October 23-25, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
3. [All Things Open](https://2024.allthingsopen.org/) in Raleigh October 27-29, 2024 for [CLS](https://allthingsopen.org/events/community-leadership-summit-cls-2)

Once again, I am thankful for [new and ongoing client work](https://cuthrell.consulting/services/), meeting folks in person that I’d previously only known online, and catching up with past co-workers. While gym and hiking continues, my list of non-technology projects took a break this week due being on the road.

As I indicated, AI Field Day was a lot to take in this week. I’ll share more once I’ve consolidated my notes.
