Over three days, I and fellow delegates took in updates from Keysight, Integrail, Cisco, VMware, Elastic,&nbsp;Arista, and&nbsp;Enfabrica <em>as well as</em> a Delegate Ignite Talk series and Delegate Roundtable! </p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>I would like to give a HUGE shout out to the team that makes Tech Field Day possible and to Futurum Group as well the sponsoring companies for making the event possible. 🙏 🙏 🙏</p></blockquote><p>What’s next?</p><ol><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://monktoberfest.com/">Monktoberfest</a> in Portland October 1-4, 2024</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/">Cloud Field Day 21</a> in Silicon Valley October 23-25, 2024 for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/events/">Tech Field Day</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://2024.allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a> in Raleigh October 27-29, 2024 for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://allthingsopen.org/events/community-leadership-summit-cls-2">CLS</a></p></li></ol><p>Once again, I am thankful for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://cuthrell.consulting/services/">new and ongoing client work</a>, meeting folks in person that I’d previously only known online, and catching up with past co-workers.
