# Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-06-014

Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.

It was a busy week. Final content from Qlik Connect in Orlando was posted to YouTube.

While I normally work out of The Vault, I was able to visit Raleigh Founded this week for a Coworking Day and Triangle Tech Night.

I’ve also published a full week of “Free Preview” posts for Hot Fudge Daily. I’ll likely collapse [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) content that is exclusively newsletter content into [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) for ONLY newsletters and reclaim [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) as a blogging platform. We shall see.

Fun fact: When I sell a $0.99 monthly subscription, Stripe takes $0.33 of that. 📉💸💵
