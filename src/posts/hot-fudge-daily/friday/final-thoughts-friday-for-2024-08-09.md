Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.

As a reminder, I’ve committed to four events for the remainder of this year. I’ve also submitted a final version of a panel to PanelPicker for SXSW 2025 voting but I won’t be speaking on a panel but might submit a solo talk — maybe.

- [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/) in Portland October 2-4, 2024
- [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) in Silicon Valley October 23-24, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)

Speaking of SXSW, [I’m organizing an awesome panel with amazing speakers on an amazing topic](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_senior-savoir-faire-the-fiercely-agentic-activity-7227352493138030595-UlT5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

This month, [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) Google Adsense is live. I’m excited to go deep into [our increasingly connected world](https://fudge.org/archive/increasingly-connected/) with “[Fudge Factor](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-factor/)”.
