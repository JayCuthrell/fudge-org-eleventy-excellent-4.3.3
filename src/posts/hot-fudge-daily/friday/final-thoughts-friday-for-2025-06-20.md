🪖 + 🧑‍💻 The story that caught my eye this week was the US Army Reserve’s Detachment 201.

At SXSW 2024, I attended a fireside chat on “<strong>Cyber Talent in the Era of Great Power Competition</strong>“. The talk was interesting and I took a few notes in my Obsidian. 

Here’s the YouTube video:

My notes:
* 77% of our youth is ineligible to serve
* Propensity to Serve is key. <ul><li>

SCIF work is the workplace. </li><li>

Hotspots exist. </li><li>

If that exists it can now enable a unique talent for no uniform roles as part of an attractive benefits, work flexibility, competitive compensation, and retention bonuses. </li><li>

Total compensation package to go full uniform is differentiated through healthcare and savings plans for military. </li></ul>
* As of late 2023, Constructive Service Credit expansion includes R&D (up to Colonel) to solve big challenges.<ul><li>

Off ramp and on ramp paths are becoming more flexible.</li><li>

Cyber and intelligence will be drawn from industry.</li><li>

Find us and we will find a way for you to serve.</li><li>

Example: Civilian to OTS to Major is 10 years and this approach does it in 6 months.</li></ul>
