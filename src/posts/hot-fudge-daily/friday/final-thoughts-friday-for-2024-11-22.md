Posting on LinkedIn about [my new role at NexusTek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaycuthrell) was well received and a great way to end the week.<figure><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaycuthrell/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="LinkedIn top performing posts" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/98d8ddef-3e08-4700-9d2f-97c8374a7ed0.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>via LinkedIn</figcaption></figure>

For the tech news stories that caught my eye this week, Palo Alto earnings and exploits have also been quite the ride.
