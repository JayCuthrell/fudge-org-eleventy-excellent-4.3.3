🍿 + 💰 One big story this week was [Netflix planning to spend ~$83B for Warner Bros Discovery](https://www.techmeme.com/251205/p13#a251205p13) to secure Warner Brothers studio, HBO, and Max.

🤖 + 💰 Also, big story for users of Limitless Pendant... Limitless is joining the Meta devices division. I guess this isn't shocking considering the increasing numbers of Meta glasses I've noticed at conferences.

🤔 While I've enjoyed using my Limitless Pendant, the company has been acquired by Meta... which is an ecosystem I try to avoid.

🗑️ So, my biggest story of the week is my plan to follow the instructions to [download a copy of Limitless data](https://help.limitless.ai/en/articles/13004987-how-to-download-your-limitless-transcripts-and-account-info) and [request deletion of Limitless data](https://help.limitless.ai/en/articles/13005203-how-to-delete-your-limitless-account-and-data) that I've enjoyed gathering since the first beta.

YMMV.
