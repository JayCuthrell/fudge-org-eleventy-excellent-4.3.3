🍿 + 💰 One big story this week was [Netflix planning to spend ~$83B for Warner Bros Discovery](https://www.techmeme.com/251205/p13#a251205p13) to secure Warner Brothers studio, HBO, and Max.

Also, big story for users of Limitless Pendant... Limitless is joining the Meta devices division. I guess this isn't shocking considering the increasing numbers of Meta glasses I've noticed at conferences.

While I've enjoyed using my Limitless Pendant, the company has been acquired by Meta... which is an ecosystem I try to avoid.

So, my biggest story of the weeks is my plan to follow the instructions to [download a copy of your Limitless data](https://help.limitless.ai/en/articles/13004987-how-to-download-your-limitless-transcripts-and-account-info) and [request deletion of your Limitless data](https://help.limitless.ai/en/articles/13005203-how-to-delete-your-limitless-account-and-data).

YMMV.
