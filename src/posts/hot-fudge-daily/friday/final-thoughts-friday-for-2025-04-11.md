The story that caught my eye this week was Agent2Agent (A2A).

If you haven't heard buzz around Model Context Protocol (MCP) then I'll try making this a cooking contest television show.

MCP would be like different chefs competing on a cooking contest show. It's entertaining but the chefs are focused on their unique recipes and making their courses unique.

A2A would be like getting different chefs to be able to collaborate as a team for the best meal possible within a budget that considers dietary restrictions. It's not just entertaining — it's arguably going to result in a better and more complete meal experience that seeks the culinary experience optima.
