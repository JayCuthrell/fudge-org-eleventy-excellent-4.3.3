ðŸ’Š + ðŸ¤– The story that caught my eye this week was [life sciences companies placing ever bigger bets on our new AI overlords](https://www.techmeme.com/251010/p15#a251010p15).

The big story this week was AstraZeneca's $555M deal to develop new drugs [which signals a strategic shift from the petri dish alone to the processing core contribution as a catalyst](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_astrazeneca-signs-555mn-ai-deal-to-develop-activity-7382454720315150336--VYf). This isn't about saving pennies on lab coats; it's about compressing the multi-billion dollar, decade-long R&D cycle timeline into a high-speed computational augmented sprint.

The race (metaphor or otherwise) is on to see if the cure for what ails you is found in a molecule or an algorithm.

Of course, this shift also means that the attention to so-called "open" life sciences movements is increasingly important as AI computation is rapidly democratized to more than the best funded and already established life sciences companies.
