As of this update, I am still wrapping up publishing my [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) delegate notes on Keysight, Integrail, Cisco, VMware, Elastic, Arista, and Enfabrica.

Once again, I am thankful for [new and ongoing client work](https://cuthrell.consulting/services/) and [catching up](https://calendly.com/jaycuthrell/catch-up) with past co-workers. Weather this week meant more indoors time for digging into my non-technology projects.

The biggest stories this week that caught me eye:
* The market for selling [$1 for $0.74](https://www.techmeme.com/240927/p23#a240927p23) is massive.
* More companies will be compelled to tell you that [you own nothing](https://www.techmeme.com/240926/p24#a240926p24).
* Open source can take steps forward in [dramatic and different ways](https://www.techmeme.com/240923/p13#a240923p13).
