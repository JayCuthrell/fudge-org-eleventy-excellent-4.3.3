The story that completely eclipsed tech earnings week was OpenAI's pivot.

[OpenAI is now a very much for-profit](https://www.techmeme.com/251028/p21#a251028p21), giving Microsoft a ~27% stake in exchange for a $250B+ Big MACC (Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment), and putting a potential [$1T IPO](https://www.techmeme.com/251029/p14#a251029p14) into motion.

Apparently, the pursuit of "benefit for all humanity" includes a vesting schedule.
