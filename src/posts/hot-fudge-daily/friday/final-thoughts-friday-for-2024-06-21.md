# Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-06-21

Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.

This week went by in a flash. I hosted [an event](https://lu.ma/y073h3oa) this morning too.

Regular readers know I normally work out of The Vault in Beaufort, NC USA. While the parking is not free, the view is legit and weather was nice [this morning](https://lu.ma/y073h3oa).

In fact, I’m considering making this event a weekly occurrence. I’ve already created the event for next week.

This week, I also published a full week of “Free Preview” posts for Hot Fudge Daily on Fudge Sunday.

Again, I’ll likely collapse [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) content that is exclusively newsletter content into [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) for ONLY newsletters and reclaim [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) as a blogging platform. We shall see.

For Hot Fudge Daily, I changed to a $9.99 yearly subscription since Stripe taking 1/3 of $0.99 monthly revenue in the prior fee structure. 📉💸💵
