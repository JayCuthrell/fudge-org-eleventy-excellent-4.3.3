<p>As of this update, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/">AI Field Day 5</a> for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/events/">Tech Field Day</a> videos are posted and I am wrapping up publishing my delegate notes on Keysight, Integrail, Cisco, VMware, Elastic,&nbsp;Arista, and&nbsp;Enfabrica <em>as well as</em> a Delegate Ignite Talk series and Delegate Roundtable.</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>I would like to give a HUGE shout out to the team that makes Tech Field Day possible and to Futurum Group as well the sponsoring companies for making the event possible. üôè üôè üôè</p></blockquote><p>Once again, I am thankful for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://cuthrell.consulting/services/">new and ongoing client work</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://calendly.com/jaycuthrell/catch-up">catching up</a> with past co-workers. Catching up on sleep from the travel means it is back to the gym and hiking in sensible shoes then digging into my non-technology projects.</p><p>The biggest stories this week were a mixed for me. On the one hand, I get that tech journalism has to earn their impressions and drive clicks. On the other hand, clicks from spicy headlines sometimes turn into reading just a few hundred words that do not support the headline. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240916/p20#a240916p20">https://www.techmeme.com/240916/p20#a240916p20</a></p><p>For context, I personally and professionally know 100s of people at AWS all over the planet. I was also on the AWS Partner Advisory Board during my time at IBM.</p><p>While I have no inside information, I can say that Return To Office (RTO) is a polarizing topic. However, I can also say that one of the Amazon leadership principles is‚Ä¶</p><blockquote><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtjBkf8qDW4">Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit</a></p><p>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles">Leadership Principles</a></p></blockquote><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240918/p34#a240918p34">https://www.techmeme.com/240918/p34#a240918p34</a></p><p>I shared <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_psa-privacy-optindefault-activity-7242142795845500928-PEYT?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">an update about this LinkedIn ‚Äúsetting‚Äù</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_im-not-a-lawyer-expect-more-emails-with-activity-7242568537213472770--aTJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">a parting thought</a> on the topic itself. </p><blockquote><p>If you reading this in the United States ‚Äî you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/data-for-ai-improvement">check your LinkedIn ‚Äúsetting‚Äù</a> at this link: </p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/data-for-ai-improvement">https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/data-for-ai-improvement</a> </p></blockquote><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p20#a240919p20">https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p20#a240919p20</a></p><p>A report on a report lands as somewhat limited coverage‚Ä¶ </p><blockquote><p>So, now do one on credit cards too! ü§î</p></blockquote><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p6#a240920p6">https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p6#a240920p6</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/physical-ppa">Physical Power Purchasing Agreements (PPA)</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/financial-ppa">financial virtual PPAs (vPPAs)</a> are entering the wider lexicon. That‚Äôs a good thing.</p><p>When I think about data centers (which is a lot), it reminds me that builders and operators of data centers work with regional power providers to secure vPPAs or PPAs as well as ensure all uses of public lands for any new transmission lines, substations, and related infrastructure builds are reviewed with the relevant utilities commission to be consistent with regulatory requirements, attestation of environmental impact including WUE/PEU as well as noise abatement commitments, zoning laws, third-party supplier agreements, and any public-private partnerships that involve permitting, construction, and neighboring community outreach/communications/etc.</p><p>That‚Äôs a lot. As it should be too! Data centers operate on the scale of a small city using the power of hundreds of thousands of homes.</p><p>Once you read more deeply into the topics, there is a case to be made that releasing more carbon into the atmosphere or pushing the heat into the atmosphere is probably a ‚Äúbad idea‚Äù ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è in the range of bad to worse ideas. But, okay, let‚Äôs go with ‚Äúnuclear bad‚Äù and make a zinger headline that conjures fears of people old enough to remember the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 2010s.</p><p>I think this is Microsoft demonstrating leadership in sourcing energy with the technology that does not fall into a worse idea category. I also think more leadership like this example from Microsoft is needed.</p><p>I believe that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-are-small-modular-reactors-smrs">small modular reactors (SMRs)</a> will become more common. I also believe that the projects of power requirements based on trend lines for current technologies need future answers to arrive faster‚Ä¶ but the market is moving right now.</p><p>Meanwhile AWS is reportedly going to go live with a 30 year (v)PPA‚Ä¶ gee‚Ä¶ <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/33038288/aws-eyes-960-mw-for-newly-acquired-nuclear-power-data-center-in-pennsylvania">I wonder what will fulfill that 30 year PPA</a>? ‚ò¢Ô∏è</p><p>Apple claims 32% of their (v)PPA supplied by‚Ä¶ gee‚Ä¶ <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2024.pdf">I wonder what that might be</a>? ‚ò¢Ô∏è</p><p>Meta / Facebook may just end up <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/mark-zuckerberg">BUILDING or BUYING their way into more power</a>‚Ä¶ gee‚Ä¶ I wonder what source? ‚ò¢Ô∏è</p><p></p><p></p>
