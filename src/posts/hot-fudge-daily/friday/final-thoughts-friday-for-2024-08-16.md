As a reminder, I’ve committed to four events for the remainder of this year.

- [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) in Silicon Valley September 11-13, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
- [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/) in Portland October 2-4, 2024
- [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) in Silicon Valley October 23-25, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
- [All Things Open](https://2024.allthingsopen.org/) in Raleigh October 27-29, 2024 for [CLS](https://allthingsopen.org/events/community-leadership-summit-cls-2)
- [SXSW](https://sxsw.com/) in Austin March 7 - 15, 2025

Speaking of SXSW, I organized an awesome panel with amazing speakers on an amazing topic. [I’d appreciate you voting (registering to vote is free) for this panel](https://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/148254).

The week in review for me is being thankful for [new client work](https://cuthrell.consulting/services/), cooler weather, and catching up with folks. As I decide what the longer term fate of these daily updates and weekly digests become, I’ll probably use this section for a “me” update of sorts.

Switching gears, the bigger tech stories this week seemed to be Patreon (and Apple), Google Gemini, FTC actions on fake reviews, A.I. safety bill contraction, and CHIPS Act grants. My thinking is this:

- At some point, deleting the Patreon app is an option as is providing feedback to companies like Patreon to encourage eschewing app investments to instead focus on making far greater value open web first designs that walled garden handheld tiny screen experiences cannot easily match.
- Gemini is useful in the Google ecosystem. The demos seem very cool ([even the ones that failed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lapi13J9UZA)) but will it be an iOS experience?
- One of the reasons I stopped using Amazon for e-commerce was the reviews seemed remotely authentic, and that was probably 10 years ago — so it highlights just how slow legislation and regulation are relative to the speed of technology.
- It was probably inevitable that the first wave of AI safety bills in the United States would be watered down or cut back in response to a whole host of objections that either came directly from the industry or via proxy and likely lobby related communications.
- Seeing CHIPS grants happen is exciting and [I hope the investments turn into a story that we look back up on fondly](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-sunday-cheap-as-chips-in-2022/) — even if I was probably a few years ahead of my time.
