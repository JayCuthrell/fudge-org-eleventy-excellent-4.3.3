Ping. Power. Plate. This was the appeal of a data center.

The biggest story of the week was the [$40B acquisition of ping, POWER, and plate represented by Aligned Data Centers](https://www.techmeme.com/251015/p19#a251015p19).

An investment consortium of BlackRock, GIP, MGX, NVIDIA, xAI, and Microsoft in a deal to buy data centers capable of delivering up to 5GW of power is a clear signal that the AI physical infrastructure is some of the most valuable real estate on the planet but not because of square footage or views of the city, mountains, or a body of water. Rather, $8M/MW, is less about the cost of land and buildings and more about securing a vast and strategic portfolio of power capacity that is essential to energize hardware that supports AI workloads.
