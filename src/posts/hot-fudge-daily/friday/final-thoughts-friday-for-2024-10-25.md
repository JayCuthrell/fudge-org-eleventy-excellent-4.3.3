Last week I was a delegate for [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) and my newsletter updates were delayed due to time commitments.

One story that caught my eye this week. Yet another venture capital (VC) firm has taken on an investment adviser persona. 

The likely potential for collisions, competition, cooperation, and collaboration between VCs and Private Equity (PE) will continue to rise.
