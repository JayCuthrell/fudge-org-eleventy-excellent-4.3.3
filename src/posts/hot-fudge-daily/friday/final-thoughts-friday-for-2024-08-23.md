As a reminder, I’ve committed to four events for the remainder of this year.

- [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) in Silicon Valley September 11-13, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
- [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/) in Portland October 2-4, 2024
- [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) in Silicon Valley October 23-25, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
- [All Things Open](https://2024.allthingsopen.org/) in Raleigh October 27-29, 2024 for [CLS](https://allthingsopen.org/events/community-leadership-summit-cls-2)
- [SXSW](https://sxsw.com/) in Austin March 7 - 15, 2025

As for me, the week in review is about being thankful for [new and ongoing client work](https://cuthrell.consulting/services/), amazing weather, and catching up with folks I haven’t spoken to for years. I also got around to finishing some languishing personal projects that have nothing to do with technology.

Switching gears back to technology, the bigger tech stories this week seemed to be AMD+ZT, Twitter drama, Microsoft Recall, Apple iOS capitulation, and US DOJ vs RealPage. My thinking is this:

- As I've said, in numerous digital locations, expect more mergers and acquisitions in pursuit of forming moats and furthering vertical integration. AMD combining with ZT makes a lot of sense when you consider the number of chips that go into hyperscale cloud service provider data centers.
- I no longer use Twitter. However, coverage on Twitter drama is something I cannot escape apparently [and boy is there drama](https://www.techmeme.com/240822/p1#a240822p1).
- Considering the recent security concerns with Microsoft in general, a slower rollout makes sense. If anything, this delay will likely provide a window for the required upgrades in systems and devices to keep up with the demands of a Microsoft Recall workload itself.
- As someone that enjoys iOS beta releases, seeing the EU compel one of the most valuable companies on the planet to alter course can be a bit surreal. Ultimately, this change in course is a net benefit to all.
- While I haven't been in the rental market recently, this allegation against RealPage is a bit of a confirmation for my prior bias. When I've considered relocating to other cities and reviewed rental pricing, anecdotally, the oddly similar patterns were hard to not notice, and perhaps the US DOJ will eventually prove this was not coincidental in a court of law.
