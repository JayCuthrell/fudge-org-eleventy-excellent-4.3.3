<p>Travel changes this week mean I am still updating my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/">AI Field Day 5</a> delegate notes that sit in my drafts pile to be published. Due to the travel changes, I also missed out on Monktoberfest (again!) but I am thankful for the amazing organizers that helped me find a way to give back in my absence.</p><p>Two big numbers stories that caught me eye this week:</p><ul><li><p>For perspective, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14">3.8 Tbps</a> is Terabits per second per second (i.e. trillions)â€¦ and is equivalent of fully saturating a 32 port 100G Ethernet LAN switch with trafficâ€¦ and then adding even more traffic on topâ€¦ but now, imagine that traffic flowing over the Internet to one place every second. My math might be off but thatâ€™s like sending two dozen compressed text copies of Wikipediaâ€¦ every secondâ€¦ or if you double-side printed the compressed text copies of Wikipedia as wartime payloadâ€¦ that would be like three Iowa-class battleships firing those Wikipedias â€”&nbsp;every second. ðŸ¤¯</p></li><li><p>Iâ€™ve written about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://hot.fudge.org/archive/?q=poolside">Poolside</a> before and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26">$500M is a staggering Series B raise</a> for the very precise focus their leadership has shared publicly. ðŸ¤¯</p></li></ul><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26">https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26</a></p><p></p>
