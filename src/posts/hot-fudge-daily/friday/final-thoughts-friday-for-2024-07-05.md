# Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-07-05

Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.

For July, I am having a weekly coffee meetup and have decided to go with LinkedIn Events then drive registrations on Luma.

Getting people to register is a lot of friction and I assumed nobody showed. But, this morning The Vault is packed with lots of day pass folks and we ran out of clean coffee cups. ☕️

Next week, for coffee, Cru is right next door to The Vault and that will be the future meeting place for Friday Coffee. The lesson learned: If the event has coffee in the name… make sure you can get coffee — so Cru it shall be!

The week after next, I’vell be heading to [Raleigh Founded - NCSU](https://www.raleighfounded.com/locations/raleigh-founded-centennial) in Raleigh July 17, 2024 for [Summer Career Fair](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/summer-career-fair-tickets-884125311607).

In August, I’m not planning heavy travel but it is TBD if I will be a delegate for [Tech Field Day Extra at SHARE](https://techfieldday.com/event/sharekc2024/) in Kansas City August 5-7, 2024.

This week, I continued the [Hot Fudge Daily](https://fudge.org/) digest posted in [🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday](https://fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-06-30) as “free” weekly content.

By next month [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) will become a funnel to drive more traffic to [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) newsletter with automated sponsorship management via Buttondown. At that point, I will reclaim [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) for blogging in ways that do not carry over easily to email.

In somewhat related news, my use of Mastodon has been pretty minimal but an interesting experiment. However, most of my social updates flow to LinkedIn these days. I just signed up for Buffer again now that free accounts can federate across three destinations. So, I am also considering a similar reclamation move for [cuthrell.com](http://cuthrell.com) to be an alias or do something with [qthrul.com](http://qthrul.com) as a holding site for [cuthrell.consulting](http://cuthrell.consulting) then formalize [cuthrell.net](http://cuthrell.net) and [cuthrell.org](http://cuthrell.org).
