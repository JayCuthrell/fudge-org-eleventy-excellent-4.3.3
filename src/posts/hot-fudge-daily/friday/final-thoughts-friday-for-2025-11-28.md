description: "Google TPU custom silicon and value chain implications"

The story that caught my eye this week was an audacious attempt by [Google to turn its custom silicon advantage into an external revenue stream](https://www.techmeme.com/251124/p41#a251124p41). By pitching [TPUs](https://techstrong.ai/aiops/ai-infrastructure-gets-googleier/) directly to the largest customers AND rivals like Meta, Google is potentially disrupting NVIDIA's pseudo-monopoly gross margins.

As for why this caught my eye, [NVIDIA's defensive "delighted" PR message](https://www.techmeme.com/251125/p32#a251125p32) was worded in a very "happy for you" meme way and the [reactions from the community](https://www.techmeme.com/251128/p21#a251128p21) have been [fascinating](https://www.techmeme.com/251128/p11#a251128p11). But, by way of analogy, if [David Bar can buy up EPG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UzDx3moasw&t=758s), [NVIDIA can buy up HBM](https://fudge.org/archive/throwback-thursday-for-2024-07-04/).

Or, said another way, NVIDIA's wording may be a subtle attempt to get ahead of future government regulatory bodies that could delay (prevent?) value chain vertical integration M&A approvals that would harm the competitive market itself. Then again, any OLESTRA / EPG to HBM / SRAM analogies could lead to more (unique) digestive discussion than these very different industries would care to encourage.

Flaky crust vs. antitrust anyone? 🍪🤖
