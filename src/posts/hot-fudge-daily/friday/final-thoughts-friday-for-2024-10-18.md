When it rains, it pours and I am unable to say “done” with my updates to [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) delegate notes. Worst case scenario, I’ll publish prior to arriving for [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) this week.

Two stories that caught me eye this week:
* Google moves towards power from small modular reactors. ⚛️ ☢️
* Amazon moves funding towards small modular reactors. ⚛️ ☢️

This makes sense. It was just a few months ago that press coverage of increasingly nuclear power options were imminent.
