# Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-06-28

Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.

This week went by in a flash. I hosted [another event](https://lu.ma/7d2bcsvg) this morning too. ☕️

Regular readers know I normally work out of The Vault in Beaufort, NC USA. While the parking is not free, the view is legit.

I’m making this event a weekly occurrence and need to decide if there is a free way to spread the word to the niche communities across Fractionals United and my LinkedIn network that is local (or might be local).

This week, I decided [Hot Fudge Daily](https://fudge.org/) will get a weekly digest posted in [🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday](https://fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-06-23) as “free” weekly content.

I’ll collapse [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) newsletter content into [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) for ONLY newsletters and reclaim [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) as a more advanced blogging platform that is not limited to email.

I'm also incredibly excited to begin using automated sponsorship features from the platform used to generate this newsletter, Buttondown. 🤑
