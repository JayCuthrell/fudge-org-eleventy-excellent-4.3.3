The tech news story that caught my eye this week was the shift from a single CPU to dual co-processors.

Strained computing analogies aside, it is fair to say my hopes for Pat Gelsinger were high. While I never worked closely with Pat, I would run into him from time to time during [my VCE years](https://fudge.org/topics/vce/).

In fact, Pat even made it into my blog post / newsletter twice!
