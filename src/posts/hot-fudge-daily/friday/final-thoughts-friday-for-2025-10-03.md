The biggest story this week is the (new) biggest private equity deal in history for a familiar name... [Silver Lake](https://www.silverlake.com/).

And now... a [similar playbook is running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Electronic_Arts)

The week saw the acquisition of video game giant Electronic Arts (EA). A consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and private equity firm Silver Lake is taking the company private for approximately $55 B.

Why (new) biggest?

Back in my days at VCE, the VMware, Cisco, and EMC relationship became more one-sided when we became an EMC Federation company in 2015. Later that same year, [we were acquired again](https://fudge.org/archive/my-fifth-year-at-vce/) by Michael Dell and.... private equity firm Silver Lake to become Dell Technologies in what was the biggest deal ever at that time.
