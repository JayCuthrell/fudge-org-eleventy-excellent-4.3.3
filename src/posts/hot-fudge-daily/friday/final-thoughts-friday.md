<h1>Final Thoughts Friday</h1><p>Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.</p><p>It was a busy week. I’m back from Qlik Connect in Orlando.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7204455902064648192/">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7204455902064648192/</a></p><p>I created a fair amount of content this week with Tech Field Day and I’ve linked to most of it in a summary article.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflecting-qlik-connect-2024-jay-cuthrell-p7gpe/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflecting-qlik-connect-2024-jay-cuthrell-p7gpe/</a></p><p>While I still need to wrap up the executive summary, I’ll share it here first.</p><p>I’ve been around alternatives to Qlik, Talend, and other companies that are part of Thoma Bravo.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.thomabravo.com/companies">https://www.thomabravo.com/companies</a></p><p>My key takeaway from Qlik Connect is that the community of users are passionate practitioners. Beyond the selection bias of attending an event named for the product and company, there is a genuine goal of getting things done for business.</p><p>I tried asking a few Qlik customers about alternatives. They have tried several alternatives but Qlik helps them get things done.</p><p>Of course, with any platform choice, there is a tendency to develop reliance. However, as just one example, the appetite for specific enhancements and updates within the Qlik community was undeniable.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_visualizations-analytics-qlikconnect-activity-7204208188487811074-CsH0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_visualizations-analytics-qlikconnect-activity-7204208188487811074-CsH0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop</a></p><p>I expect that Qlik Talend Cloud and Qlik Answers will have impressive high impact stories from the community within a few months of the GA release dates. I also expect that the community will have powerful case studies within less than a year in time for Qlik Connect 2025.</p><ol class="footnotes"></ol>
