# Final Thoughts Friday

Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.

It was a busy week. I’m back from Qlik Connect in Orlando.

I created a fair amount of content this week with Tech Field Day and I’ve linked to most of it in a summary article.

While I still need to wrap up the executive summary, I’ll share it here first.

I’ve been around alternatives to Qlik, Talend, and other companies that are part of Thoma Bravo.

My key takeaway from Qlik Connect is that the community of users are passionate practitioners. Beyond the selection bias of attending an event named for the product and company, there is a genuine goal of getting things done for business.

I tried asking a few Qlik customers about alternatives. They have tried several alternatives but Qlik helps them get things done.

Of course, with any platform choice, there is a tendency to develop reliance. However, as just one example, the appetite for specific enhancements and updates within the Qlik community was undeniable.

I expect that Qlik Talend Cloud and Qlik Answers will have impressive high impact stories from the community within a few months of the GA release dates. I also expect that the community will have powerful case studies within less than a year in time for Qlik Connect 2025.
