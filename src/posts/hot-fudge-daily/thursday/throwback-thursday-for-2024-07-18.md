# 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-07-18

Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet. As I come across Twitter URLs in my newsletter archive, I am finding that the change in Twitter ownership, degradation of URLs (link rot), and the transition between different newsletter platforms has made much of this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

For example, if you were to look back a few years or even a few months, you’d probably have wondering how many M&A stories would be happening at the rate they appear to be in 2024.

[Wiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiz_(company)) - At just over 4 years of age, this toddler has become a cybersecurity business growth success engine that has reportedly attracted the attention of Google.

Three months ago I highlighted a quote from the CEO of Wiz.

Three months later… a possible shot and chaser.
