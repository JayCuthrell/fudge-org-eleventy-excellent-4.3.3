<h1>Throwback Thursday for 2024-07-11</h1><p>Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "<a href="https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Shot and Chaser</a>". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.</p><p><a href="https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/</a></p><p>Past examples of "<a href="https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Shot and Chaser</a>" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet.

From early protections from DDoS attacks from bot nets running on compromised PCs on residential broadband, the additions of similar protections from similar bots (likely running on AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) scraping websites for data to feed into A.I. models has been an interesting turn of events in the industry.</p><figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NET/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="NET from 2019 to Present" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/3e3885ac-2393-4520-b736-ae27c4ff00f0.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>NET from 2019 to Present</figcaption></figure><p></p><p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240704/p18#a240704p18" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.techmeme.com/240704/p18#a240704p18</a></p><p></p><p></p><ol class="footnotes"></ol>
