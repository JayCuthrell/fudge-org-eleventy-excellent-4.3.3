# Throwback Thursday for 2024-07-11

Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet. As I come across Twitter URLs in my newsletter archive, I am finding that the change in Twitter ownership, degradation of URLs (link rot), and the transition between different newsletter platforms has made much of this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

For example, if you were to look back 5 years and analyze press coverage of the all things cloud, you’d probably have waved off any concerns for A.I… bubble or not.

[Cloudflare](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NET/) - At just 15 years of age, this teenage titan of the cloud has made a big impact by simply not being AWS, Azure, GCP, or any other hyperscale cloud service provider — they are truly their own thing. From early protections from DDoS attacks from bot nets running on compromised PCs on residential broadband, the additions of similar protections from similar bots (likely running on AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) scraping websites for data to feed into A.I. models has been an interesting turn of events in the industry.
