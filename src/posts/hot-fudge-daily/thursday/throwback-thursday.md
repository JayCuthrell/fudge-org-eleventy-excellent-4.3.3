<h1>Throwback Thursday</h1><p>Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/">Shot and Chaser</a>". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/">https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/</a></p><p>Past examples of "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/">Shot and Chaser</a>" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet. As I come across Twitter URLs in my newsletter archive, I am finding that the change in Twitter ownership, degradation of URLs (link rot), and the transition between different newsletter platforms has made much of this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.</p><p>Here's an example from 20 years ago.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/06/is-nvidia-doomed-to-be-the-next-cisco-what-investo/">https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/06/is-nvidia-doomed-to-be-the-next-cisco-what-investo/</a></p><p>This week, I'll simply reflect on the shot and chaser that seems to be top of mind for everyone. NVIDIA, depending on the refresh of your browser, is one of the most "valuable" companies in existence based solely on that arbitrary measurement known as market capitalization or "market cap" for short.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/3571bfcf-e2e1-45e5-86f3-d72db7dbb4a2.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-06 at 8.53.17â€¯AM.png" draggable="false" contenteditable="false"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Motley fools indeed.</p><ol class="footnotes"></ol>
