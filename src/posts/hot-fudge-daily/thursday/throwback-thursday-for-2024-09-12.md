By providing and managing this second-generation hardware and software platform, Intel Online Services can offer a higher degree of predictability and reliability. This can also reduce the cost for customers, since they don't have to hire IT staffs, buy computers, configure software, or carry out other costly tasks. Intel Online Services, Inc., is an Intel subsidiary that intends to be a leading supplier of hosted Internet services, business applications, and e-Commerce services worldwide.</span></p></blockquote><p>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/in040400.htm">Intel News Release, 2000</a></p><p>By 2000, IOS announced it would allocate $1B to bring <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/in040400.htm">10 Internet Data Centers (IDCs)</a> online.</p><p>By early 2002, IOS had signed customers with iconic brands such as Sony, eBay, BP, Tour de France, EMI, MSN,&nbsp;American Stock Exchange, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, BBC, </span><span>and others with partners like EMC that provided technology for hosting ‚Äú</span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/cn112700.htm">multiple terabytes of storage</a><span>‚Äù that seem rather quaint today but was bleeding edge a quarter century ago.</span></p><p>However, life moves fast and so did the .com boom.
