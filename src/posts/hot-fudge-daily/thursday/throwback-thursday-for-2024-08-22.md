Throwback Thursday is based upon the classic Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)".

Basically, Throwback Thursday is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

Encryption has been an increasingly thorny topic in the news as technology, privacy, and policy collide. For example, if you were to look back a few years ago, you might have thought the [Sky ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_of_Sky_Global) story was over.

In fact, the story was only just beginning. This week, Sky ECC made news again.

What makes this story interesting is the parallels of accessing encrypted messages years later as we face a future [Y2Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later). Notably, NIST standards for PQC arrived recently as well.
