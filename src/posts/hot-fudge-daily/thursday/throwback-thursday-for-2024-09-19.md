Have you visited [the “Killed by Google” website](https://killedbygoogle.com/) before?

The reason I ask in this ⬅️ Throwback Thursday is because Google is getting into the passkey management business with a new product.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p28#a240919p28](https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p28#a240919p28)

I had so many thoughts about this that I decided to open my dictation and note summarization stack from Limitless AI. 🤓<figure><a href="https://www.limitless.ai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Limitless AI" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/998d0567-93e2-433a-8293-04e5ff9ee888.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>[https://www.limitless.ai/](https://www.limitless.ai/)</figcaption></figure>

Limitless isn’t perfect but it is helpful for turning 10 minutes of me talking extemporaneously while staring at Techmeme into a set of notes and observations. 🤓

I’ve hyperlinked where appropriate as Limitless doesn’t know (or isn’t supposed to know) what I’m looking at on screen while I’m talking. 🤓<h2 node="[object Object]"><em>Notes and Observations</em></h2>
* <strong><em>Google's Entry into Passkey and Password Manager Sector</em></strong><em>:</em><ul><li>

[Google is entering the password manager and passkey sector](https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p28#a240919p28)<em>, prompting a discussion about the longevity and trustworthiness of Google's products, given </em>[Google’s track record of discontinuing things](https://killedbygoogle.com/)<em>.</em></li><li>

<em>The implications of Google managing </em>[passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/)<em> were highlighted, given the potential for service shutdowns and the domain Google could have over users' security keys.</em></li></ul>
* <strong><em>Passkeys and the Rise of New Security Standards</em></strong><em>:</em><ul><li>

[Passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/)<em> represent a focus on combating phishing and simplifying user account management, especially as systems become more interconnected.</em></li><li>

<em>Key developments took place leading up to the formation of </em>[FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/)<em> in February 2013.</em></li><li>

[Passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/)<em> are </em>[a relatively new concept](https://www.techmeme.com/101101/p32#a101101p32)<em>, with Microsoft and Apple showcasing demos of functionality for passkeys over the past few years. Outside of specific vendors, </em>[FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/)<em> is working on open authentication standards to enhance security overall.</em></li></ul>
* <strong><em>Trust and Compatibility Concerns</em></strong><em>:</em><ul><li>

<em>Discussion centered around which companies (e.g., Apple, Google) consumers should trust with their passkeys and whether these systems will allow for seamless migration of security information if necessary.</em></li><li>

[Google](https://www.techmeme.com/221012/p13#a221012p13)<em> and </em>[Apple](https://www.techmeme.com/220827/p11#a220827p11)<em> have been encouraging users to create passkeys, aiming to phase out traditional passwords.</em></li></ul>
* <strong><em>Potential Industry Shifts</em></strong><em>:</em><ul><li>

<em>Google's moves could pose competitive challenges to Apple's ecosystem, which typically restricts passkeys to Apple devices.</em></li><li>

<em>Google's approach hints at broader compatibility across device manufacturers and operating systems, unlike Apple's more vertically integrated (closed) system.</em></li></ul>
* <strong><em>Questions About Product Longevity</em></strong><em>:</em><ul><li>

[Google's past with product lifecycles](https://killedbygoogle.com/)<em> raises questions about the long-term viability of their password management solutions.</em></li><li>

<em>Despite Google Chrome's continued success, other products have been polarizing or discontinued, leading to skepticism about the new password manager’s longevity.</em></li></ul>

Well, I do think that Limitless AI notes and observations make me sound very negative. 🤣 Actually, I think any products or services that moves us beyond usernames and written passwords on notes attached to computer screens or desks is a very good thing.

I went back and read my transcript and the color of my word choice probably favored a summary that reads heavily skewed towards words like “concern” and “skepticism” even if that is a reference to other perspectives that are not necessarily mine.
