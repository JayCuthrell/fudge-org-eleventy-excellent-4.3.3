<p>In this Thankful Throwback Thursday I am thankful for the web browser technology that has arguably made my career since the 1990s possible starting with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">NCSA Mosaic</a> to my modern day daily drivers â€” Safari and Chrome.</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Click.</p><p>Click.</p><p>Click.</p></blockquote><p>Long ago, back in the ancient times ofâ€¦ 2008, Google Chrome was launched as a Windows browser alternative in that most Google of releasesâ€¦ a Beta. These were the days of desktops and laptops with phones being mostly feature phones.</p><p>Of course, the year before, Apple released iPhone with it, the Safari mobile browser. Safari on the Mac was ~4 years old by then and Safari on Windows was ~1 year old (but wouldnâ€™t be around for more than a few more years).</p><p>Within just a few years, Google Chrome had been ported to reach most popular operating systems. Also, Google Chrome was now considered a browser worth tracking by market percentage use.</p><p>By 2010, alternative browser popularity was still solidly in the shadows of Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE). Meanwhile, the mobile world was growing rapidly.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/121002/p9#a121002p9">https://www.techmeme.com/121002/p9#a121002p9</a></p><p>By 2012, Chrome became available (yes, as a Beta) on Android. Now, there was a growth in mobile browsers besides Safari on iPhone and Safari on Windows has reached its nadir â€” and Chrome reached parity with MSIE.</p><figure><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-201206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a0aecb77-52a9-455d-88a3-ac02324ac345.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Browser stats 2009-2012" draggable="false"></a><figcaption>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-201206">https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-201206</a></figcaption></figure><p>By 2013, Safari on iPhone had taken a commanding lead as a mobile browser.
