Back in 2010, short URLs were still very much in vogue because a shorter URL is a better URL, right? 

Not to be outdone, [Google even offered a short URL service](https://www.techmeme.com/100407/p60#a100407p60)… with a QR (quick-response) code too!

Of course, many short URLs services have gone away over the years with the links becoming link rot (or worse). As you might expect, QR codes are not without their own challenges.

Oh… and Google’s short URL and QR code service “[goo.gl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_URL_Shortener)” is no more.
