In these modern times of $1000+ smart phones, it is interesting to look back 15 years to when an [iPhone 3GS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_3GS) sold 1M units in a weekend.

It was also just 15 years ago that you could get a [Palm Pre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Pre) which sold… only 0.1M units in an entire week.

The Palm Pre ran [webOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS). Today, webOS is running on 150M+ devices that are [much larger than a phone](https://webos.developer.lge.com/webos-hub).

The iPhone 3GS ran [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS). By comparison, iOS is now running on 2B+ devices ranging from the size of a phone to the size of a tablet… but [tvOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS) is probably running on less than ~100M devices connected to flat panel TV screens.
