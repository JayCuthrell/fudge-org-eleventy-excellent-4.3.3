<p>In a very special Thankful Throwback Thursday, we consider the ancient times ofâ€¦ <em>[checks notes]</em> two years ago when Google launched NotebookLM.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/231208/p13#a231208p13">https://www.techmeme.com/231208/p13#a231208p13</a></p><p>A lot can happen at Google in two years. This is especially true in the world of AI. So, a few months ago, I even tried recent updates to Google NotebookLM. (pretty cool stuff!)</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/testing-google-notebooklm-2024-jay-cuthrell-fgvpe/?trackingId=GGXsoEnSR5%2BxcTy%2BTwd9IQ%3D%3D">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/testing-google-notebooklm-2024-jay-cuthrell-fgvpe/?trackingId=GGXsoEnSR5%2BxcTy%2BTwd9IQ%3D%3D</a></p><p>Andâ€¦ itâ€™s probably not shocking that there is some nostalgia in looking back while the Google NotebookLM team undergoes their own updates exactly two years later.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241205/p4#a241205p4">https://www.techmeme.com/241205/p4#a241205p4</a></p>
