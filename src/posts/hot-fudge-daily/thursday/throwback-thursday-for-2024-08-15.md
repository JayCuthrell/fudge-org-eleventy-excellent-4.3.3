Throwback Thursday is based upon the classic Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding tweets. However, as I come across tweets in my newsletter archive, I find the change in Twitter ownership, removed URLs (link rot), and transitions between newsletter platforms rendered this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

Thankfully, there is Techmeme. Techmeme is pretty great at historical views.

For example, if you were to look back twenty years ago, the first year of LinkedIn was probably slow until it wasn’t. But if you look back almost fifteen years ago, you’d probably wonder how much more LinkedIn could grow from their [2011 success of reaching 100 Millions users globally](https://www.techmeme.com/110322/p18#a110322p18).

Today, there are reportedly ~200 Million users of LinkedIn just within the United States.

This week, the attention of tech journalists turned to the growing contributions by influencers and A.I. generated (amplified?) content (noise?) in this increasingly popular destination.
