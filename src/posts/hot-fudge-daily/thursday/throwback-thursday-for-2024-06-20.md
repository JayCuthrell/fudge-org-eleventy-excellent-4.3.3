# Throwback Thursday for 2024-06-20

Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet. As I come across Twitter URLs in my newsletter archive, I am finding that the change in Twitter ownership, degradation of URLs (link rot), and the transition between different newsletter platforms has made much of this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

For example, if you were to look back at [IPOs from 10 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2014_initial_public_offerings), you’d probably recognize several companies. Considering just technology, a handful are quite notable.

[Arista Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arista_Networks) - While it might be hard to imagine a time before Arista, the company that made Cisco “[big mad](https://www.techmeme.com/180806/p21#a180806p21)”, their entry into the networking market that began as drama now offers more innovative forms of drama that continue to this day in the tech press that never miss the opportunity to call out Arista origin stories in the headlines.

[HubSpot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HubSpot) - Your inbox probably contains multiple emails driven by HubSpot powered businesses. As HubSpot has grown to a marketing software juggernaut, reporting indicates they have recently [re-attracted](https://www.techmeme.com/240404/p25#a240404p25) the attention of potential buyers along the way.
