# Throwback Thursday for 2024-06-27

Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet. As I come across Twitter URLs in my newsletter archive, I am finding that the change in Twitter ownership, degradation of URLs (link rot), and the transition between different newsletter platforms has made much of this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

For example, if you were to look back to 2019 press coverage, you’d probably recognize how much the future was going to be awful based on the coverage at the time. Well, okay them.

[Red Hat and IBM](https://www.techmeme.com/190627/p18#a190627p18) - While it might seem like it has been longer than 5 years, IBM got approval from the very young EU to acquire Red Hat — and IBM stock has continued to rise another ***~30%***.

[Apple](https://www.techmeme.com/190627/p30#a190627p30) - When Jony Ive announce leaving Apple the gloom and doom coverage was fascinating — but in the past 5 years, Apple stock has continued to rise an eye popping ***330%+***.
