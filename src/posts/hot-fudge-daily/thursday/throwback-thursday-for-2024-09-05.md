<p>My early career in the late 1990s was in telecommunications. I worked for a company called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKjAMxzdrHw">Nortel Networks</a> before I pivoted to become a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org/archive/and-for-my-next-trick/">global road warrior / consultant</a> during the .com boom.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKjAMxzdrHw</p><p>Back then a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù on a network diagram was often meant to depict the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/09/26/Sprint-to-offer-new-data-transmission-network/5008654321600/">Sprint frame relay network</a>. Times have changed a bit since then and ‚Äú<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2011/10/31/257406/who-coined-cloud-computing/">cloud computing</a>‚Äù became ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù we know today.</p><p>Over the years, traditional telecom wireline business (copper telephone lines) fell into a less desirable category as mobile, broadband, high speed fiber optics networks, and cloud computing took hold of investor attention.</p><p>If you remember AT&amp;T at SXSW 2009, the mobile carrier was trying but was unable to keep up with all the Internet connected mobile devices. The following year the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/a-year-later-att-shines-at-sxsw/">lessons learned from many thousands of mobile phones trying to reach the Internet in one small city</a> went into motion for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQAEd3fjhY">SXSW 2010 using many COWs</a>.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQAEd3fjhY</p><p>Of course, AT&amp;T wasn‚Äôt the only mobile carrier. There was also Verizon.</p><p>For example, if you were to look at my writing back in 2010, you might have associated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://1000logos.net/verizon-logo/">Verizon</a> with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://readwrite.com/day-1-verizon-developer-commun/">cutting edge technology</a>. You might have even considered Verizon to be a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://readwrite.com/day-2-verizon-developer-commun/">developer oriented</a> company.</p><p>In fact, Verizon got into the cloud business in 2011. Verizon Cloud was born!</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/press-releases/verizon-completes-terremark-acquisition">https://www.verizon.com/about/news/press-releases/verizon-completes-terremark-acquisition</a></p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>So too did AT&amp;T have cloud ambitions, but that‚Äôs for another Throwback Thursday.
