My early career in the late 1990s was in telecommunications. I worked for a company called [Nortel Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKjAMxzdrHw) before I pivoted to become a [global road warrior / consultant](https://fudge.org/archive/and-for-my-next-trick/) during the .com boom.

Back then a “cloud” on a network diagram was often meant to depict the [Sprint frame relay network](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/09/26/Sprint-to-offer-new-data-transmission-network/5008654321600/). Times have changed a bit since then and “[cloud computing](https://www.technologyreview.com/2011/10/31/257406/who-coined-cloud-computing/)” became “the cloud” we know today.

Over the years, traditional telecom wireline business (copper telephone lines) fell into a less desirable category as mobile, broadband, high speed fiber optics networks, and cloud computing took hold of investor attention.

If you remember AT&T at SXSW 2009, the mobile carrier was trying but was unable to keep up with all the Internet connected mobile devices. The following year the [lessons learned from many thousands of mobile phones trying to reach the Internet in one small city](https://www.telecompetitor.com/a-year-later-att-shines-at-sxsw/) went into motion for [SXSW 2010 using many COWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQAEd3fjhY).

Of course, AT&T wasn’t the only mobile carrier. There was also Verizon.

For example, if you were to look at my writing back in 2010, you might have associated [Verizon](https://1000logos.net/verizon-logo/) with [cutting edge technology](https://readwrite.com/day-1-verizon-developer-commun/). You might have even considered Verizon to be a [developer oriented](https://readwrite.com/day-2-verizon-developer-commun/) company.

In fact, Verizon got into the cloud business in 2011. Verizon Cloud was born!

> So too did AT&T have cloud ambitions, but that’s for another Throwback Thursday. We’ll get there.

However, cloud computing had been pioneered at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft for over a decade and by 2017, Verizon got out of the cloud computing business it had acquired in 2011.

Oh, and remember Sprint and that version of the original “cloud”?

Well, $26B later in 2020 dollars…

Also, the cloud within the US market is now firmly associated with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, IBM, and a growing number of niche providers from REITs to XaaS players.

Still, within the US market, the largest names associated with telecom became AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.

However, there were many other telecom brands that were operating as well but far below the size of AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.

Fast forward to the present… What old is what’s new again.
