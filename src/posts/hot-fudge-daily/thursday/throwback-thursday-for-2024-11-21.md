Back in the ancient times of… ~7 months ago… I produced my most re-shared LinkedIn post in several years.

[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_wiz-ceo-2024-will-be-the-year-of-acquisitions-activity-7182523881671282688-mGaO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_wiz-ceo-2024-will-be-the-year-of-acquisitions-activity-7182523881671282688-mGaO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Curiously, the same day that Google and Wiz allegedly agreed to not agree on M&A terms, there was another post that got coverage.

Fast forward to today…
