### 🟦 + ⬛️ One story that caught my eye this week

It seems that Microsoft will be changing the classic (mid 90s era) Blue Sreen of Death (BSOD) to… 

[checks notes] 

***Black*** Screen of Dealth. (so, still BSOD?)

RIP BSOD (1993-2025)

Long Live BSOD (2025-????)

(and my commentary on Blacksky… I mean Bluesky)
