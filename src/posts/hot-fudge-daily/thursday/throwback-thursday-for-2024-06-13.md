# Throwback Thursday for 2024-06-13

Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet. As I come across Twitter URLs in my newsletter archive, I am finding that the change in Twitter ownership, degradation of URLs (link rot), and the transition between different newsletter platforms has made much of this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

For example, if you were to look back at [IPOs from 20 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2004_initial_public_offerings), you’d probably recognize several companies. Considering just technology, a handful are quite notable.

[Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) - While it might be hard to imagine a time before Google, the company that once took attention away from the TV and drove us all to use browsers has expanded to… well, go back after the TV under different terms.

[CBRE Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBRE_Group) - If you’ve been to a major city with what appears to be empty buildings, it is worth noting that return to office (RTO) will likely become an equilibrium as the democratization of technology and [thinking remotely](https://fudge.org/archive/thinking-remotely/) and data centers are growing more than ever in the REIT category.
