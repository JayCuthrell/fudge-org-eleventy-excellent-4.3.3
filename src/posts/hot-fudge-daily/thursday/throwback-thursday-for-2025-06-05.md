🤖 + 🧫 One story caught my eye this week was Cortical Labs announcing the shipping of their biological computer this summer.

For perspective, organoid computing and organoid intelligence running atop biological operating system… (BIOs — get it?) has been getting [more coverage](https://newatlas.com/computers/finalspark-bio-computers-brain-organoids/) lately.

Back in 2009, even Intel was describing [our biological computing future](https://www.techmeme.com/090209/p70#a090209p70).

During the 1970s, if you watched the TV series, Tomorrow People, then you might remember their biotic computer, [TIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tomorrow_People#Cast).
