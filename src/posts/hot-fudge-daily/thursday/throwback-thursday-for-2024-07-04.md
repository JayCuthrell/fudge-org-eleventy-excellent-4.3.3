<h1>Throwback Thursday for 2024-07-04</h1><p>Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "<a href="https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Shot and Chaser</a>". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.</p><p><a href="https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/</a></p><p>Past examples of "<a href="https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Shot and Chaser</a>" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet.
