<p>Datacenter power consumption has been a below the fold news topic in the past but has ramped along with coverage of recurring topics of A.I. which is even more power intensive. But how long has there been a datacenter energy crisis?</p><p>In short, the datacenter energy crisis has always been there. The difference is that modern datacenter demands are now hyperscale cloud service providers.</p><p>For example, if you were to look back to 2007, you might recall so-called green datacenter initiatives like “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070514190956/http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/presskit/21440.wss" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IBM Project Big Green</a>” in response to the datacenter energy crisis.</p><figure><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070518070012/http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/21524.wss" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="IBM Project Big Green in 2007" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/0024d31f-57b9-492c-903d-1c892651207b.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>via archive.org</figcaption></figure><p>Fast forward to the present… What makes “green” claims so interesting is how the established datacenter players are always looking for better power purchase agreements (PPAs) or virtual power purchase agreements(vPPAs) terms — but is always about more electrons, not less.</p><p>Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Apple do their own tracking as well. However, the coverage of how that tracking is done has raised more questions.</p><p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240814/p10#a240814p10" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.techmeme.com/240814/p10#a240814p10</a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
