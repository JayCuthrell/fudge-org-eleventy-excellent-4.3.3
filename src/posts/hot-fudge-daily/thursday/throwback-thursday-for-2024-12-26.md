I was born in 1972. So was SAP.

20-ish years later, my early career started at Nortel Networks. By 1998, CRM and computer telephony interface (CTI) had become a big thing while the word Internet occurred ~35 times in the Nortel Networks Annual Report that year.

By 1999, CRM was big enough that Nortel Networks went on to buy Clarify.

At that time, I decided to leave Nortel Networks and chase .com consulting dreams for a few years as a globe trotting consultant. Meanwhile, SAP and Nortel did a CRM deal.

A fear years later, SAP and the Nortel Networks + Clarify deal fell apart. So too did my .com dreams.

By 2009, [Nortel no longer existed](https://www.techmeme.com/090114/p31#a090114p31) and I had been steadily heading in the direction of hybrid cloud services. Oddly enough, SAP was headed that way too.
