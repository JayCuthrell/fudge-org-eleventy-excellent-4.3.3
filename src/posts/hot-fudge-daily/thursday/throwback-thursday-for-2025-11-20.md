Here is what was making waves in tech history on this day.

The orderly transfer of power for the US Govt was performed... using [a Google Workspace and Titan Security Keys](https://www.techmeme.com/201120/p9#a201120p9).

#### 10 Years Ago: [November 20, 2015](https://www.techmeme.com/151120/h2355)

If you were a cola fan, you might have been in the market for... the [Pepsi Phone](https://www.techmeme.com/151120/p32#a151120p32).

#### 15 Years Ago: [November 20, 2010](https://www.techmeme.com/101120/h2355)

[COICA (Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act)](https://www.techmeme.com/101120/p2#a101120p2) was the latest bill attempting to balance concerns with censorship and IP protections... it would fail, but only to be rewritten as the [PROTECT IP Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s968)... which also failed to advance.
