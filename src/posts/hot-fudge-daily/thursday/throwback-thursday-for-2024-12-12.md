Here in the US, a [mobile virtual network operator (MVNO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator) is a fairly recent part of our telecom history.

~20 years ago, [there was a Google Phone and a Yahoo! Phone](https://web.archive.org/web/20051204100258/http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticleSearch.aspx?storyID=59051+07-Nov-2005+RTRS&srch=yahoo) and even a [Disney Phone](https://www.engadget.com/2005-07-06-disney-announces-disney-mobile.html).

And now… a recent $73M Series-B is making it even easier for MVNO ambitions to be set in motion.
