Throwback Thursday is based upon the classic Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding tweets. However, as I come across tweets in my newsletter archive, I find the change in Twitter ownership, removed URLs (link rot), and transitions between newsletter platforms rendered this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

Thankfully, there is Techmeme. Techmeme is pretty great at historical views.

For example, if you were to look back a ten years ago, you’d probably have been wondering how many Google device related headlines there would be.

Over a decade ago, Google entered the consumer hardware business.

This week, that entry has exited.
