Interesting links that might converge one day, soon.

* [AI can interview you about your use of AI](https://claude.ai/interviewer): Anthropic did a thing y'all
* [Microsoft VibeVoice](https://microsoft.github.io/VibeVoice/): Microsoft's open-source text-to-speech (TTS) of multi-speaker audio and that makes me wonder what the new generation of remix punk community will do with this
* [Agentic AI categories for AWS AI Competency](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/new-agentic-ai-categories-for-aws-ai-competency-partners): Expecting to see some stratification among AWS Partners (currently dozens)
* I interpret [this](https://www.techmeme.com/251209/p36#a251209p36) as succession planning in the open or the intentional telegraphing of active succession planning in the open.

So, imagine, one day in the not too distant future when a there are easily sourced succession planning interview outcomes at the C-level that are conducted by an Agentic AI interviewer using a human-like voice that is well outside of the uncanny valley... all of which are underpinned by AWS managed services.
