<h1>Welcome to the age of 🌶️ Hot Fudge Sunday</h1><blockquote class="pullquote">

🙏 A big thank you to our sponsors. 🙏<br/>(Scroll to the end…)</blockquote>

As promised, Hot Fudge Sunday 🤔 💡 🤯 🤓 is (now) a free weekly newsletter and Hot Fudge Daily is now a daily paid newsletter at [https://fudge.org](https://fudge.org) in a single easy to reach URL. That’s right, the free weekly edition is posted every… wait for it… Sunday.<figure><a href="https://unsplash.com/@m_usm04?utm_source=Buttondown&utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="double dutch ice cream in glass" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1571089465427-cd3c533e809f?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w2Mjg2OTV8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyN3x8ZnVkZ2V8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzIyNzM3NDY5fDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080"/></a><figcaption>Photo by [Muhammad Usman](https://unsplash.com/@m_usm04?utm_source=Buttondown&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Buttondown&utm_medium=referral)</figcaption></figure>

Originally, Fudge Sunday weekly newsletter was hosted at a variety of newsletter services until I moved the (badly exported and malformed) archives to [fuge.org](https://fudge.org) which was where my much older long form blog post lived. Eventually, I decoupled the archives from Buttondown (which powers Hot Fudge Daily and now Hot Fudge Sunday).<h2>Fudge Factor</h2>

Over the coming months, [fudge.org](https://fudge.org) will transition to niche posts. Niche posts will go very very deep with a rebrand as “Fudge Factor”.

<em>For example…</em>

Back in 2022, I wondered out loud how impactful [OTel](https://fudge.org/archive/please-please-otel-me-now/) would be. I asked at the end of my post… <blockquote class="pullquote">

<em>So, how will OTel </em><strong><em>factor</em></strong><em> into the next industrial revolution?</em></blockquote>

In 2024, OpenTelemetry (OTel) is even more interesting and the packaging of OTel for wider adoption continues. i.e. [A.D.O.T.](https://github.com/orgs/aws-observability/projects/4)

I will continue to write at [fudge.org](https://fudge.org) and [fudge.org](https://fudge.org) consistently using [P.O.S.S.E.](https://fudge.org/archive/me-and-my-posse/) principles.

I will still have a RSS to email syndication enabled. However, “Fudge Factor” content will be niche — and if you want to unsubscribe, no worries.

Buttondown and Activepieces have enabled me to think about my own syndication to LinkedIn and platforms like Flipboard. For more advanced syndication, I might end up going to [Automatisch](https://automatisch.io/). 

We shall see.<h2>Audience Feedback</h2>

Ultimately, I think the biggest takeaway is going to be how readership reacts and clicks. Indeed, audience replies to newsletters are endorphins.

This notion of an audience also came up in a 2020 blog post by an actual professional writer, Bruce Sterling. I share it here now, along with another quote without further comment.<blockquote>

“So I came to understand that creative work that pleased the markets did not much affect people personally.“<br/>— Bruce Sterling</blockquote><blockquote>

“if you want to become original, you should keep an eye out for whatever you don't-have-to” <br/>— Bruce Sterling</blockquote>
