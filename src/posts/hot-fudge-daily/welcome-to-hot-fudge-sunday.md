<h1>Welcome to the age of 🌶️ Hot Fudge Sunday</h1><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>🙏 A big thank you to our sponsors. 🙏<br>(Scroll to the end…)</p></blockquote><p>As promised, Hot Fudge Sunday 🤔 💡 🤯 🤓 is (now) a free weekly newsletter and Hot Fudge Daily is now a daily paid newsletter at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://hot.fudge.org">https://hot.fudge.org</a> in a single easy to reach URL. That’s right, the free weekly edition is posted every… wait for it… Sunday.</p><figure><a href="https://unsplash.com/@m_usm04?utm_source=Buttondown&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1571089465427-cd3c533e809f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3w2Mjg2OTV8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyN3x8ZnVkZ2V8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzIyNzM3NDY5fDA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" alt="double dutch ice cream in glass" draggable="false" contenteditable="false"></a><figcaption>Photo by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://unsplash.com/@m_usm04?utm_source=Buttondown&amp;utm_medium=referral">Muhammad Usman</a> on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Buttondown&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Originally, Fudge Sunday weekly newsletter was hosted at a variety of newsletter services until I moved the (badly exported and malformed) archives to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org">fuge.org</a> which was where my much older long form blog post lived. Eventually, I decoupled the archives from Buttondown (which powers Hot Fudge Daily and now Hot Fudge Sunday).</p><h2>Fudge Factor</h2><p>Over the coming months, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org">fudge.org</a> will transition to niche posts. Niche posts will go very very deep with a rebrand as “Fudge Factor”.</p><p><em>For example…</em></p><p>Back in 2022, I wondered out loud how impactful <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org/archive/please-please-otel-me-now/">OTel</a> would be. I asked at the end of my post… </p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p><em><span style="font-family: Comic\ Sans\ MS, Comic\ Sans">So, how will OTel </span></em><strong><em><span style="font-family: Comic\ Sans\ MS, Comic\ Sans">factor</span></em></strong><em><span style="font-family: Comic\ Sans\ MS, Comic\ Sans"> into the next industrial revolution?</span></em></p></blockquote><p>In 2024, <span style="color: rgb(99, 108, 118)">OpenTelemetry (</span>OTel) is even more interesting and the packaging of OTel for wider adoption continues. i.e. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/orgs/aws-observability/projects/4">A.D.O.T.</a></p><p>Curious?

However, “Fudge Factor” content will be niche — and if you want to unsubscribe, no worries.</p><p>Buttondown and Activepieces have enabled me to think about my own syndication to LinkedIn and platforms like Flipboard. For more advanced syndication, I might end up going to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://automatisch.io/">Automatisch</a>. </p><p>We shall see.</p><h2>Audience Feedback</h2><p>Ultimately, I think the biggest takeaway is going to be how readership reacts and clicks. Indeed, audience replies to newsletters are endorphins.</p><p>This notion of an audience also came up in a 2020 blog post by an actual professional writer, Bruce Sterling. I share it here now, along with another quote without further comment.</p><blockquote><p>“<span style="color: rgb(26, 26, 26)">So I came to understand that creative work that pleased the markets did not much affect people personally.</span>“<br><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)">— Bruce Sterling</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)">“if you want to become original, you should keep an eye out for whatever you don't-have-to” <br>— Bruce Sterling</span></p></blockquote><p>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2020/05/farewell-beyond-beyond/">https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2020/05/farewell-beyond-beyond/</a></p><p></p>
