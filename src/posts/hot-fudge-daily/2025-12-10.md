M&A holiday shopping season has been on a tear lately.

Side note: I'm also seeing "The agent couldn’t complete with its current set up." from my Google Workspace Studio. Granted, it's a new service and I'm not paying any premium for it. Still, a bit disappointing but also understanding. The service is likely being hugged to death as rollout widens beyond the fun alpha access I enjoyed before.

Back to the M&A deals... focusing just on tech and only the first 10 days of December 2025:

* IBM buys Confluent
* Meta buys Limitless
* OpenAI buys Neptune
* ServiceNow buys Veza
* LogicMonitor buys Catchpoint
* Marvell buys Celestial AI
* Anthropic buys Bun

And... there are probably more to come.
