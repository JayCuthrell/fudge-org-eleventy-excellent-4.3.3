<p>As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…</p><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3><p>For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week.

## 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2025-01-22
 
Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-01-23
 
One headline for a Thursday Throwback caught my eye. Specifically, the claim of ~5.6 Tbps of traffic during the peak of _one_ DDoS attack.

https://www.techmeme.com/250122/p10#a250122p10

For perspective, in 2013 there was _one_ DDoS attack that "almost broke the Internet" which was claimed to be ~0.085 Tbps of traffic.

https://www.techmeme.com/130327/p29#a130327p29

My point is, the comparisons are quite a bit different. The mitigation techniques and expansion of the Cloudflare business has likely changed. 

Also likely is those differences have turned into a different kind of data claim for marketing purposes. So, I do wonder if the claims will one day relate to the theoretical throughput of a modern multi-Tbps Ethernet switch slot or a collection of switches at fully populated slot capacity.
