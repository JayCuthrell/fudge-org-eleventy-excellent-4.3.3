## This Week

I have no travel plans and I'm looking forward to tuning up more automation.

## 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-08-25
My screener is getting closer!

| Symbol | Company Name | % Change |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| [ASTS](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ASTS:NASDAQ) | AST SpaceMobile, Inc. | +5.88% |
| [RBLX](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/RBLX:NYSE) | Roblox Corporation | +5.84% |
| [NN](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NN:NASDAQ) | Nextnav Inc. | +5.36% |

Wackyparse RetCon Thesis: AST SpaceMobile and Nextnav are focused on new connectivity and precision location infrastructure to... play Roblox? 🤣

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-08-29
📶 🗼 🛜 I believe biggest story of the week was the sale of spectrum licenses. 

Addition of spectrum can increase competitiveness and ORAN could (should?) expand.

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-08-30
🌮 + 🍔 + 🍟 + 🥤 + 🗣️ + 🤖 = 🤔

When it works, you'll know — eventually. In some use cases, there are reasons for tactile knobs, dials, and buttons are better than touch screens.

The same might be said for humans and mobile apps being better than the current imagination for AI powered fast-food ordering in a drive-thru.

In 2025, voice ordering from a standard drive-thru fast food menu connected to AI is still challenging.

In 2024, the challenge was just as stark.

In 2023, the learning curve was steep.

In 2019, the aspirational goals were just starting to form.
