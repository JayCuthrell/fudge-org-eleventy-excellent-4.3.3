<p>Welcome to 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday!</p><p>Uncover the spicy inspiration behind this week's Fudge Sunday edition, packed with deep links and fresh insights. 🔥</p><p>I just published the latest edition of Fudge Sunday. 🚀</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org/archive/project-liberty-and-dsnp/">https://fudge.org/archive/project-liberty-and-dsnp/</a></p><p>Fudge Sunday readers have asked me about my writing process. I’ve been very transparent with these questions and I am even working with a few readers on their own newsletters and writing process. 🎗️</p><p>For Fudge Sunday, I am typically waking up on Sunday morning with no idea what I’m going to write about then getting somewhere between 500-1000 words hammered out in the afternoon or early evening. 🔥</p><p>Sometimes, I’m literally inspired by an email that arrived in the past few days. Today is one such example. 🌶️</p><p>Sometimes, I have a topic that was unknown to me that comes up during the week. And sometimes, I remember that topic. 🤞</p><p>I wrestled with two things today. I wanted to write about a deeply technical topic related to the conference I added this week. 🤨</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflecting-qlik-connect-2024-jay-cuthrell-p7gpe/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflecting-qlik-connect-2024-jay-cuthrell-p7gpe/</a></p><p>Instead, I linked to my LinkedIn Article. The topic I had in mind will have to wait. 🫷</p><h2>Back to the spicy…</h2><p>Yesterday, I woke up and remembered an email from Thursday that caught my eye that might be the <em>perfect inspiration</em> for Fudge Sunday newsletter. Next, like a hyper stimulated Jack Russell Terrier, I decided to see what effort would be required to update node.js, my 11ty stack, and the starter framework from 1.x to 3.1.0… and jumped into code. 🐿️</p><p>Wait. Whut. ⁉️</p><p>Oh, you were expecting some grand galaxy brain thinking on my part? <em>Nope. 🙂‍↔️</em></p><p>Thankfully, I remembered that I had remembered that email after the humbling reminder that I am not a good software developer, coder, directions follower, etc. 😭</p><p>As I got into the links from the email, I found myself going deeper and deeper in the rabbit hole. 🕳️</p><p>I kept having déjà vu. Was this Diaspora Part Deux? 🧐</p><p>Was this really a billionaire discussing the merits of TCP/IP? How was such a thoughtful treatise on Interwebs history, shifting societal norms, and turnkey tyranny tales eminating from someone the news painted as a real estate guy? 🤔</p><p>So, I kept clicking and found myself thinking this is a story that needs wider dissemination to my readership. Next, I crafted the deep links that I thought mattered most and tapped out the latest edition of Fudge Sunday with those deep links along the way. 🚀</p><p>Again, I’m not that deep — but my links are. I get my inspiration and I go tappy tap on the keyboard. ⌨️</p><ol class="footnotes"></ol>
