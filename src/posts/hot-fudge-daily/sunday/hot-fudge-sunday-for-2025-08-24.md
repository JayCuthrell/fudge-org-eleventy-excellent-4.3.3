## Last week

I was fortunate to contribute a few comments for [NexusTek, in an article on CNBC regarding recent Microsoft licensing changes](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/20/microsoft-guidance-probably-includes-gutting-volume-discounts-analyst.html). We also published more details on [NexusTek Insights](https://www.nexustek.com/insights/microsofts-licensing-evolution-and-what-it-means-for-customers).

Also, [Jason Pullo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-pullo-61927b9/) of [ESP, a NexusTek company](https://www.nexustek.com/esp) shared his thoughts on how [technology is making dining experiences smarter than ever before](https://www.nexustek.com/insights/ai-cloud-technology-modern-restaurants).

Finally, [Jason Thatcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-thatcher-464a4a35a/) of [NexusTek](https://www.nexustek.com/solutions/managed-detection-response) joined [NexusTek Winners Circle](https://www.brighttalk.com/channel/20887/) to share perspectives on [why managed detection and response (MDR) gives back time to busy security teams](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/20887/650826).

The second biggest story is the market reaction.

## üîÆ Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-08-23
 
In case you missed this one in the Friday news dump:

https://www.techmeme.com/250822/p28#a250822p28

Balkanization of Internet has been a recurring dystopian theme since at least as far back as the 1990s. A "403 Forbidden" due to political power [is still possible in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_States#State_laws) even in the year 205.
