## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). Previously, I participated in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) for a year after leaving IBM, rebooting [Cuthrell Consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting), and [joining NexusTek](https://cuthrell.consulting/blog/jay-cuthrell-joins-nexustek/).

Since late last year, I’ve also been highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. This week I’m simplifying as the About section updates were not getting updated (by me) in a timely fashion.

Week over week, the list grew until I had to add an Alumni 🎉 section this week for those that have transitioned from [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) to their next career adventure.

## 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-05-12

Readers have shared that the measurement I've been using paints a stark picture on Monday. So, what about looking at the end of the week instead?

[![Screenshot 2025-05-18 at 1.44.03 PM.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6c6567b5-7ae1-4d3c-b14d-fe7a37fab9b5.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/9bda6c7b-fe9e-41ca-9da9-e281a4a9889a/)

## 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2025-05-13

Playful naming and elements of whimsy are on the decline but it is fascinating to see how long some design elements last.

## 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2025-05-14

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-05-16

There's an old saying about "Ma Bell" reforming again but with a different name to dominate modern communications within the US. Recent M&A activity seems to support that prophetic direction for cable and broadband.

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-05-17

Ah yes, the plot thickens as full vertical integration by ever larger tech companies — from services to software to silicon to the solitary generation of electrons underpinning all of it — comes into focus.
