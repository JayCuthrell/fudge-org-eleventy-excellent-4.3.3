## Last Week

It was a short but busy week of [NexusTek professional services](https://www.nexustek.com/it-consulting/professional-services) updates, [a digital transformation in horticulture discussion with Griffin Greenhouse Supplies](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/20887/652183), and a [Tech Field Day Podcast on Agentic AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCrrotz6Wms
) too.

## This Week

I'll be traveling this week but hope to get some more automation refinements put in place.

## 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-09-01

Labor Day meant US markets were closed. The quiet allowed me to to ponder pre-market news coverage. Notably, three articles caught my attention in reference to China verticalization (aka vertical integration) and the lack of AI value chain connections to NVIDIA, [H20](https://fudge.org/archive/final-thoughts-friday-for-2025-08-15/) or otherwise.

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-09-05

The biggest story of the week is the advances in the crossover of art and science that will become increasingly democratized. Brave. New. World.

https://www.techmeme.com/250905/p4#a250905p4

There is a nostalgia meme that compares early computer graphics in popular games to their modern equivalent. So, imagine today's Synthesia in a decade becoming the equivalent of a classic 1980s arcade game or early CGI in movies.

The implications of deepfake shifting from simulacrum to artifice to imperceptible is going to compound. Or, perhaps, in-person interviews and in-person certification examination will remain the standard for trust and non-repudiation.

Or...

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-09-06

Sometimes, $600B just comes out in polite conversation. Twice?

https://www.techmeme.com/250905/p14#a250905p14

Of course, one of the $600B by 2028 is hard to fathom considering the most recent number for 2025 is *only* $65B per Meta.

https://www.techmeme.com/250319/p42#a250319p42

What could $600B mean? Well, what if it applied to: 

- Selection of strategic global locations
  - US Southwest, Northeast, and Central
  - Sweden 
  - Australia
- Commitment to 3 year "get to green' AI data center designs
  - strategic land purchases for thousands of acres
  - state and regional vPPA negotiations with investments
- Construction of data centers optimized for AI workloads
  - procurement of best-in-class AI infrastructure
  - construction of solar power generation sites
  - construction of power-storage facilities
  - commissioning SMR power infrastructure designs
- Consumption of AI infrastructure
  - procurement of best-in-class AI infrastructure
  - evolving with the latest generation of AI chips
  - begin transition to custom silicon AI chips
  - begin addition of quantum computing
- Give excess power back to the grid by 2030
  - convert to 100% solar and SMR
  - fully transition to custom silicon AI chips
  - fully transition to custom silicon and quantum computing

![What If](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f2010e72-743e-4c6d-8f90-a04b74d3affe.png?w=960&fit=max)

This would be the equivalent of a cookie-cutter approach to building multiple sites with a [Topaz Solar Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topaz_Solar_Farm), dual SMRs, and enough vPPA to keep an AI-first design data center footprint humming along. Also, by adding to and evolving the latest generation of AI chips with an eye towards the quantum computing future, it could easily use up $600B (or more) in less than 3 years.

Oh, and just by setting aside even ~$30B might enable some of that AI compute to be flying over our heads one day.
