# Spicy Edition Sunday for 2024-06-23

Welcome to 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday!

Uncover the spicy inspiration behind this week's Fudge Sunday edition, packed with deep links and fresh insights. 🔥

As a quick reminder, longer form [Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org/) topics are posted weekly on at [https://fudge.org/](https://fudge.org/).

## 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday

{{ subscribe_form }}

🗓️ Last week, a seven ( 7 ) day roundup of [Hot Fudge Daily](https://fudge.org) was included in [Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org/). Based on feedback, this week will be the last digest in the series and my workflow will revert to the original longer form content of [Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org). 

🆕 As of this update, [Hot Fudge Daily](https://fudge.org) the weekly digest will be posted in [🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday](https://fudge.org/) as "free" weekly content. This seems to strike a balance for different reader interests and helps me streamline my workflow as a writer.

## 📈 Markets Monday

Looking at the week behind for the tech market.

I typically ask Siri how NASDAQ is doing and wait to hear it if is a big change or not. Siri logic on the definition of what to say if the there is +/- < 1% seems to be varied by day of attempts. More experimentation or going deeper into how Siri makes word choices will be interesting as the new Apple WWDC stories of Siri evolve over the year. 

Previously, I mentioned adding a 5 day view contrasted with a 5 year view.

I have only a context of “this seems to be going up for now”.

## This week

Looking at the week ahead for the tech market.

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.

Just before Apple WWDC, I recorded a podcast with some predictions. I think I did okay! 🤓

## 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday

A few things that caught my attention today in big funding and M&A moves in tech.

## Funds, Funding, and M&A

[https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p25#a240618p25](https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p25#a240618p25)

📊 + ⚖️  Expect more breathless coverage of relative market cap jockeying between Apple, Microsoft, as the FAANG, MAANG, etc. swap out letters or do enough M&A with stock for the EU and US Government to determine who’s ripe for disassembly.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p15#a240618p15](https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p15#a240618p15)

🚚 + 🤖 Fun fact: When I lived in Las Vegas just over a decade ago, there were parts of the highway system between Nevada and Arizona that were approved for semi-autonomous trucking.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p2#a240618p2](https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p2#a240618p2)

🔮 + 🤖  While I don’t use my college degree much (Materials Science and Engineering), it is fascinating to see how the quest for novel or first mover advantage in materials science is approaching A.I. alchemy status.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240614/p2#a240614p2](https://www.techmeme.com/240614/p2#a240614p2)

🧙 + 🤖 Same thing. Just replace alchemy with potions. But seriously, consider the fact that potential MRSA remedies date back to a time where slathering on garlic, onions, wine, and bile was probably cutting edge proper compounding at the time. 

[https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p17#a240618p17](https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p17#a240618p17)

🔐 + 🤑 As the appetite for Enterprise cybersecurity size M&A enjoys big bets status for the next 2-3 years, I expect higher velocity MSSP and cybersecurity related deals like this to continue in 2024. 

## 🤪 Wacky Wednesday

One unique thing about online Slack Communities is the use of #random channel. Sometimes you come across some real gems.

Each week I go through dozens of Slack communities and select the most interesting shared links found. This will be a safe for work list.

Join me in this collection of what is being shared that is wow, wild, wtf, and wacky each Wednesday.

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday

# Throwback Thursday for 2024-06-20

Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

[https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/)

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet. As I come across Twitter URLs in my newsletter archive, I am finding that the change in Twitter ownership, degradation of URLs (link rot), and the transition between different newsletter platforms has made much of this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

For example, if you were to look back at [IPOs from 10 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2014_initial_public_offerings), you’d probably recognize several companies. Considering just technology, a handful are quite notable.

[Arista Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arista_Networks) - While it might be hard to imagine a time before Arista, the company that made Cisco “[big mad](https://www.techmeme.com/180806/p21#a180806p21)”, their entry into the networking market that began as drama now offers more innovative forms of drama that continue to this day in the tech press that never miss the opportunity to call out Arista origin stories in the headlines.

[HubSpot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HubSpot) - Your inbox probably contains multiple emails driven by HubSpot powered businesses. As HubSpot has grown to a marketing software juggernaut, reporting indicates they have recently [re-attracted](https://www.techmeme.com/240404/p25#a240404p25) the attention of potential buyers along the way.

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday

{{ subscribe_form }}

This week went by in a flash. I hosted [an event](https://lu.ma/y073h3oa) this morning too.

Regular readers know I normally work out of The Vault in Beaufort, NC USA. While the parking is not free, the view is legit and weather was nice [this morning](https://lu.ma/y073h3oa).

In fact, I’m considering making this event a weekly occurrence. I’ve already created the event for next week.

[https://lu.ma/7d2bcsvg](https://lu.ma/7d2bcsvg)

This week, I also published a full week of “Free Preview” posts for Hot Fudge Daily on Fudge Sunday.

[https://fudge.org/archive/hot-fudge-daily-digest/](https://fudge.org/archive/hot-fudge-daily-digest/)

Again, I’ll likely collapse [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) content that is exclusively newsletter content into [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) for ONLY newsletters and reclaim [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) as a blogging platform. We shall see.

For Hot Fudge Daily, I changed to a $9.99 yearly subscription since Stripe taking 1/3 of $0.99 monthly revenue in the prior fee structure. 🤯🧐💸

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday

{{ subscribe_form }}

Unveiling overlooked tech news with a sprinkle of satire.

## Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Yes, a play on words.

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.

## Why Sneak Peak?

It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week. Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
