## Last Week

I migrated from Mastodon and decided on [GoToSocial](https://codeberg.org/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial). It was pretty smooth but it is still [early days for the Fediverse](https://cuthrell.com/@jay/statuses/01K510H6R4NR22EVJA4TFDTEWR). Also, [Jason Pullo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-pullo-61927b9/) at [ESP, a NexusTek company](https://www.nexustek.com/esp) shared insights on the [top cybersecurity challenges in Hospitality](https://www.nexustek.com/insights/cybersecurity-challenges-in-hospitality).

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-09-12

I think the biggest story this week was Oracle's $300B win.

https://www.techmeme.com/250910/p43#a250910p43

That's *a lot* of power. Twinkie for scale.
