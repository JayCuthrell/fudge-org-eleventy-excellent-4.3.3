However, this was not with the large telecom companies, but with the small rural and very much fiercely independent operators. The common name for these companies was rural local exchange companies or RLECs.</p><p>Eventually, my career did involve working with the very largest telecom providers on the planet. However, my affection for the independent operators continues, and I have enduring respect for their public private partnerships that have enabled Internet access for many that would not otherwise have received it from the largest telecom providers.</p><p>As for the lawsuit mentioned in these articles from the large telecom providers, I would only suggest that they spend more time thinking about what is happening literally above their heads in LEO and how they will respond instead of trying to litigate entry-level tiers of service as terrestrial facilities based broadband providers.</p><p>Less courtroom tactics.
