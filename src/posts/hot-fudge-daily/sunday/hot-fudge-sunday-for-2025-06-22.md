## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-06-21
 
<p>Ah, the Friday news dump. By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.</p><h3>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h3><p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><p>🤔 🤨 🧐 Just a couple that caught my technologist eye…</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250620/p27#a250620p27">https://www.techmeme.com/250620/p27#a250620p27</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250621/p8#a250621p8">https://www.techmeme.com/250621/p8#a250621p8</a></p><p></p>
