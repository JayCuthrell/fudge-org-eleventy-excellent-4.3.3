## üîÆ Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-09-20

Once again, I‚Äôve selected a Friday news dump item that reached a peak level of trope, clich√©, or bromide on the slowest news day that may be attempting to avoid wider coverage.

35 years ago, the [H1-B visa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa) came into existence. It has grown over the years as have periodic calls for both greater expansion and reforms.

At a time in history where slow news days are rare, a Friday update on significantly higher H1-B visa fees gained attention and speculation. First, an Executive Order (EO) was summarized and linked with highlights of the eye watering $100,000 fee being imposed by the EO.

https://www.techmeme.com/250919/p23#a250919p23

My first thoughts were how this might impact offshore consulting firms. In terms of impact, I wondered specifically about the largest global systems integrators (GSIs).

https://bsky.app/profile/cuthrell.com/post/3lzaco5ai422i

As of Saturday, more news reporting attempted to clarify ambiguity and charitability of interpretation of the H1-B visa fees increase. Naturally, updates behind paywalls and speculation in the open are both increasing on the topic.

https://www.techmeme.com/250920/p12#a250920p12

Considering the news ecosystem skews heavily towards tech for beat reporting, blogs, social platforms, streaming platforms, and email newsletters, it is reasonable to expect the H1-B visa topic will probably be in the news cycle for a few more weeks.
