### 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-11-24
The screener is lighting up with a very specific theme today: Future Compute Architecture.

Quantum Computing is having a breakout moment with double-digit gains.

Digital Infrastructure & Crypto Mining trade is back, likely driven by the continued pivot toward high-performance computing (HPC) capacity. Also, optical connectivity and autonomous systems point to a big day for the hardware layer of the stack.

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-11-27
Looking back on this day in tech history... Let's take a look at what was making headlines on this day many years ago.

#### 5 Years Ago: [November 27, 2020](https://www.techmeme.com/201127/h2355)

Five years ago, [SignalFrame (Wireless Registry)](https://www.techmeme.com/201127/p6#a201127p6) briefly entered the lexicon of [IoT data harvesting](https://web.archive.org/web/20240324140903/https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/the-apps-are-not-what-they-seem) via mobile app SDKs that enabled smart phones to canvas "[billions of detectable WiFi and Bluetooth signals](https://web.archive.org/web/20201208202327/https://signalframe.com/)"... and is now part of [PWC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/products/connected-solutions.html).

#### 10 Years Ago: [November 27, 2015](https://www.techmeme.com/151127/h2355)

Ten years ago, the [Microsemi acquisition of PMC-Sierra](https://www.techmeme.com/151127/p9#a151127p9) powered the progression of the 5G and cloud backbones... and is now part of [Microchip Technology](https://www.techmeme.com/180301/p31#a180301p31).

#### 15 Years Ago: [November 27, 2010](https://www.techmeme.com/101127/h2355)

Fifteen years ago, [Angry Birds reached 7M downloads](https://www.techmeme.com/101127/p5#a101127p5)... and is now part of [Sega](https://www.techmeme.com/230417/p1#a230417p1) with 5B+ downloads.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-11-28
The story that caught my eye this week was an audacious attempt by [Google to turn its custom silicon advantage into an external revenue stream](https://www.techmeme.com/251124/p41#a251124p41). By pitching [TPUs](https://techstrong.ai/aiops/ai-infrastructure-gets-googleier/) directly to the largest customers AND rivals like Meta, Google is potentially disrupting NVIDIA's pseudo-monopoly gross margins.

As for why this caught my eye, [NVIDIA's defensive "delighted" PR message](https://www.techmeme.com/251125/p32#a251125p32) was worded in a very "happy for you" meme way and the [reactions from the community](https://www.techmeme.com/251128/p21#a251128p21) have been [fascinating](https://www.techmeme.com/251128/p11#a251128p11). But, by way of analogy, if [David Bar can buy up EPG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UzDx3moasw&t=758s), then perhaps [NVIDIA can buy up HBM](https://fudge.org/archive/throwback-thursday-for-2024-07-04/).

Or, said another way, NVIDIA's wording may be a subtle attempt to get ahead of future government regulatory bodies that could delay (prevent?) value chain vertical integration M&A approvals that would harm competition. Then again, any OLESTRA / EPG to HBM / SRAM analogies could lead to more (unique) digestive discussion than these very different industries would care to encourage.

Flaky crust vs. antitrust, anyone? 🍪🤖

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-11-29
While Thanksgiving leftovers digested and the consumer mosh pit of Black Friday rolled into motion, [the futures financial system scrambled and needed some #HugOps](https://www.techmeme.com/251128/p8#a251128p8). Indeed, the narrative of decentralized, resilient, redundant cloud infrastructure isn't defacto and is not ubiquitous (yet).

CME Group operates the world's largest financial derivatives exchange and is on track to be a massive Google Cloud customer over the next several years. But due to the current CME Group architecture used to deliver those services, a "[cooling systems issue](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/cooling-issue-at-data-center-halts-futures-trading-for-cme-group/)" meant the operation halted.

In 2025, a single physical point of failure to a cooling system can freeze global futures markets for hours. Even in our timeline of increasing compute density and strained power grids, thermal management is still a critical uptime vulnerability and we are only as robust as our HVAC design.
