I surveyed readers about offering a shorter version of the newsletter. Results were mixed so I’m shortening the newsletter and moving sections around this week.

## 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-05-19

As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…

<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

This week:

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-05-23
 
<p>🤖 + 🔮 The story that caught my eye this week was Waymo reaching 10M paid rides. Granted, even 10M total rides is a mere drop in the bucket compared to human operated Lyft and Uber rides <strong><em>every day</em></strong>. </p><p>Waymo will disrupt the gig economy slowly as it ramps. Just as the human switchboard operator role had a peak, that peak gave way increasingly automated digital telecommunications solutions.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250520/p56#a250520p56">https://www.techmeme.com/250520/p56#a250520p56</a></p>
