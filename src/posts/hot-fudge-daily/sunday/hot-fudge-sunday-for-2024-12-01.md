As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week…<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Once again, many green things continue to appear." draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/12b78f69-f6c7-4924-ac41-69cb2cc43511.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>Green things appeared last week.</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.

Two hot takes on the two stories caught my eye on Tuesday from companies both started in the ancient times of 2021.

🧬 + 🤖 Seeing a company like [Cradle](https://www.cradle.bio/) take $73M Series B is amazing and the funding may assist the creation of an [open-source Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) dataset for antibody binders](https://www.cradle.bio/blog/antibody-ngs-data-initiative).

[https://www.techmeme.com/241126/p9#a241126p9](https://www.techmeme.com/241126/p9#a241126p9)

🦄 + 🤖 Unicorns are born of funding and the… [Halcyon](https://www.halcyon.ai/) days 🤓of applying Capsule Networks (CNNs) via CapNet to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) has led to a $100M Series C.

[https://www.techmeme.com/241125/p19#a241125p19](https://www.techmeme.com/241125/p19#a241125p19)

Bonus: Great [Bluesky thread](https://bsky.app/profile/poller.bsky.social/post/3lbrtl37pmd2f) from [Jack Poller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackpoller/)

[https://bsky.app/profile/poller.bsky.social/post/3lbrtl37pmd2f](https://bsky.app/profile/poller.bsky.social/post/3lbrtl37pmd2f)

Bonus bonus: Perhaps Halcyon ([AI](https://www.halcyon.ai/)) will be so successful that another Halcyon ([Eco AI](https://halcyon.eco/)) will be needed to better manage energy consumption used to combat attacks powered by… AI?

In this Thankful Throwback Thursday I am thankful for the web browser technology that has arguably made my career since the 1990s possible starting with [NCSA Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic) to my modern day daily drivers — Safari and Chrome.<blockquote class="pullquote">

Long ago, back in the ancient times of… 2008, Google Chrome was launched as a Windows browser alternative in that most Google of releases… a Beta. These were the days of desktops and laptops with phones being mostly feature phones.

Of course, the year before, Apple released iPhone with it, the Safari mobile browser. Safari on the Mac was ~4 years old by then and Safari on Windows was ~1 year old (but wouldn’t be around for more than a few more years).

Within just a few years, Google Chrome had been ported to reach most popular operating systems. Also, Google Chrome was now considered a browser worth tracking by market percentage use.

By 2010, alternative browser popularity was still solidly in the shadows of Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE). Meanwhile, the mobile world was growing rapidly.

By 2012, Chrome became available (yes, as a Beta) on Android. Now, there was a growth in mobile browsers besides Safari on iPhone and Safari on Windows has reached its nadir — and Chrome reached parity with MSIE.<figure><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-201206" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Browser stats 2009-2012" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a0aecb77-52a9-455d-88a3-ac02324ac345.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>Source: [https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-201206](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-201206)</figcaption></figure>

By 2013, Safari on iPhone had taken a commanding lead as a mobile browser. Increasingly, mobile was part of the browser market share story.

Fast forwarding to this year, Google Chrome isn’t just popular… it’s the most popular browser as measured by market share. But, as the saying goes about a tall poppy… it gets noticed.

For anyone that left comments on my LinkedIn Warrior post, thank you -- I tried to reply to everyone but the UI/UX isn't perfect. If for some reason, I didn't get a reply back to you --- belated THANK YOU!

The tech news story that caught my eye this week was a reported subsea fiber deployment plan. $10B is a large exclusive investment even for Meta (Facebook).

[https://www.techmeme.com/241129/p7#a241129p7](https://www.techmeme.com/241129/p7#a241129p7)

Then again, Google has seen reporting of numerous regular subsea fiber deployments going back 15+ years.

In fact, cooperation between Facebook and Google seemed possible 3 years ago.

Prior cooperation included multiple partnerships 7 years ago.

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.<h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4>

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.<h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4>
