# Hot Fudge Daily Digest

I'm testing a new format below... I'm trying to get the newsletter to be leaner and get back to pure Markdown.   

## üìà Markets Monday for 2025-07-28
 
I'm stopping the screenshots for Markets Monday. Instead, I will begin looking back at the week over week on Monday using a screener. 

More to come...

## ü§™ Wacky Wednesday for 2025-07-30

## üîô Throwback Thursday for 2025-07-31
 
3 **Billion** iPhones.

https://www.techmeme.com/250731/p50#a250731p50

18 years ago, rumors swirled.

https://gizmodo.com/rumor-3g-iphone-coming-227850

When the iPhone launched, it was [$499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qycUOENFIBs).

If you had invested $499 in AAPL 18 years ago, you would have $20,421 today. That's enough to buy about one dozen iPhone 16 Pro Max 1TB.
   
## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-08-01
 
ü§ñ + üí∞ The big story this week isn't a single product launch but the staggering scale of AI value chain infrastructure investment.

Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet alone are set to drop the [GDP equivalent of the entire Chilean economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chile) on their AI value chain infrastructure just this year.

## üîÆ Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-08-02
 
The Friday news dump selection this week goes to...

https://www.techmeme.com/250801/p26#a250801p26

I'm not a lawyer but I would expect to see appeals from Tesla. I would also expect to see counsel at General Motors, Ford, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Kia watching closely for the line of business for keeping humans in a driver seat.

Meanwhile, driverless continues to be rack up miles with Waymo and Zoox in more places more of the time as humans shift to the backseat as riders. Also, there are companies such as Aurora, Nuro, and May Mobility that are challenging the need for human drivers within the supply chain of long haul and last mile logistics for both people and cargo.
