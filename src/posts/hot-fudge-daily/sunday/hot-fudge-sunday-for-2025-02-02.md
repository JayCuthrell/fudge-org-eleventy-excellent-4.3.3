One headline for a Thursday Throwback caught my eye.

https://www.techmeme.com/250130/p9#a250130p9

🤳🏻 🛰️ Amazing.

15 years ago, Vodafone enabled [the first "World" phone](https://www.techmeme.com/100807/p12#a100807p12) by combining both CDMA and GSM networks in a single handheld consumer device.

20 years ago, Vodafone enabled precursors to [the first mobile access routers with wifi for teams](https://www.techmeme.com/050913/p3#a050913p3) by collaborating with Linksys on their iconic ubiquitous Linksys WRT54 design that had just turned 2 years old.
