Good times. I’ll collapse [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) newsletter content into [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) for ONLY newsletters and reclaim [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) as a more advanced blogging platform that is not limited to email.

I'm also incredibly excited to begin using automated sponsorship features from the platform used to generate this newsletter, Buttondown. 🤓

Analyzing the past and future of the tech market in Markets Monday.

Looking at the week behind for the tech market.

I typically ask Siri how NASDAQ is doing and wait to hear it if is a big change or not. Siri logic on the definition of what to say if the there is +/- < 1% seems to be varied by day of attempts. More experimentation or going deeper into how Siri makes word choices will be interesting as the new Apple WWDC stories of Siri evolve over the year.

Previously, I mentioned adding a 5 day view contrasted with a 5 year view.<figure><img alt="NASDAQ 5 day view" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/401eddca-6e98-4363-aa87-549ab264a1ea.png?w=960&fit=max" style="width: nullpx !important; display:block; margin:auto;"/><figcaption>5 day view</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="NASDAQ 5 year view" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f996a8c4-5726-406f-8f3c-806117ab46e7.png?w=960&fit=max" style="width: nullpx !important; display:block; margin:auto;"/><figcaption>5 year view</figcaption></figure>

And so, “this seems to be going up for now”, is still true on a long enough timeline.

Looking at the week ahead for the tech market.

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.<figure><img alt="Stock Heat Map view last week" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6c710f6d-f19b-4591-a376-269b78c8990a.png?w=960&fit=max" style="width: nullpx !important; display:block; margin:auto;"/><figcaption>Heat Map view last week</figcaption></figure>

And… the winners list narrowed from a dozen to… five.<figure><img alt="Stock Heat Map view this week" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/84cbf859-e1ad-409d-9d82-1e8d588b54c4.png?w=960&fit=max" style="width: nullpx !important; display:block; margin:auto;"/><figcaption>Heat Map view this week</figcaption></figure>

If you are using Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.

I didn’t have any podcasts or other recorded insights but I did find a few updates on Mastodon and LinkedIn. One link shows the importance of breaking up the few into the many. One link shows, well, not that.

Off the cuff analysis in a rapid fire format.

A few things that caught my attention today in big funding and M&A moves in tech yesterday… and the trend was A.I. related.

AI dominates tech funding and M&A moves, shaping a future of bioengineered indicators and internal data mastery.<h2>Funds, Funding, and M&A</h2>

[https://www.techmeme.com/240625/p14#a240625p14](https://www.techmeme.com/240625/p14#a240625p14)

🏭 + 🤖 This is exactly the kind of funding that is going to accelerate a cheap as chips outcome.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240625/p11#a240625p11](https://www.techmeme.com/240625/p11#a240625p11)

🍪 + 🤖 We are only in the very earliest of stages for what will be incredible levels of specialization in custom silicon.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240625/p8#a240625p8](https://www.techmeme.com/240625/p8#a240625p8)

🧬 + 🤖 Imagine a world where everything around us has bioengineered indicators based upon novel GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) designs of A.I. origins.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240625/p1#a240625p1](https://www.techmeme.com/240625/p1#a240625p1)

🗄️ + 🤖 Under the guise of the recruiting game shifting from external focus to internal data mastery is probably going to become increasingly popular as a less than subtle form of persistent employee monitoring.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240624/p20#a240624p20](https://www.techmeme.com/240624/p20#a240624p20)

🧑‍💼 + 🤖 In related news, by 2030, agentic A.I. will be similar to the fancy digital calculators and ergonomic staplers that were once indispensable parts of the modern office in the 1990s.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240624/p19#a240624p19](https://www.techmeme.com/240624/p19#a240624p19)

💸 + 🤖 Literal non-page turner document analysis is perfectly suited for A.I. and is precisely the kind of utility that makes massive impacts in time savings for creative time that could be spent elsewhere in the business.

{{ subscribe_form }}<h2>🔙 Throwback Thursday</h2>

Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

[https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/)

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet. As I come across Twitter URLs in my newsletter archive, I am finding that the change in Twitter ownership, degradation of URLs (link rot), and the transition between different newsletter platforms has made much of this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

For example, if you were to look back to 2019 press coverage, you’d probably recognize how much the future was going to be awful based on the coverage at the time. Well, okay them.

[Red Hat and IBM](https://www.techmeme.com/190627/p18#a190627p18) - While it might seem like it has been longer than 5 years, IBM got approval from the very young EU to acquire Red Hat — and IBM stock has continued to rise another <strong><em>~30%</em></strong>.

[https://www.techmeme.com/190627/p18#a190627p18](https://www.techmeme.com/190627/p18#a190627p18)

[Apple](https://www.techmeme.com/190627/p30#a190627p30) - When Jony Ive announce leaving Apple the gloom and doom coverage was fascinating — but in the past 5 years, Apple stock has continued to rise an eye popping <strong><em>330%+</em></strong>.

Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.

This week went by in a flash. I hosted [another event](https://lu.ma/7d2bcsvg) this morning too. ☕️

Regular readers know I normally work out of The Vault in Beaufort, NC USA. While the parking is not free, the view is legit.

I’m making this event a weekly occurrence and need to decide if there is a free way to spread the word to the niche communities across Fractionals United and my LinkedIn network that is local (or might be local).

This week, I decided [Hot Fudge Daily](https://fudge.org/) will get a weekly digest posted in [🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday](https://fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-06-23) as “free” weekly content.

Unveiling overlooked tech news with a sprinkle of satire.<h2 style="text-align: start">Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h2>

Yes, a play on words.

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.<h2 style="text-align: start">Why Sneak Peak?</h2>

It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week. Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.<h2>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h2>
