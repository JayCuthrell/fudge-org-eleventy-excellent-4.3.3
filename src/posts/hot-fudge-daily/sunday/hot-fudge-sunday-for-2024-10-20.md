For Market Monday, I look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things at the closing bell on Monday.<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-14" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/81ad1387-0786-4058-8149-5ec4da11783c.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-14</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

Two hot takes on two stories that caught my eye on Tuesday.

💰 + 🤖 When a ~8X sized SPV is made (compared to the investment 5 years ago) as part of an already eye-watering round, it means AI FOMO is very real.

[ where oh where will the workloads live… ]</blockquote>

💰 + 🏗️ A $2B raise for 3 data centers in the US reflects that AI FOMO requires a physical home too.

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities. I then select the most interesting shared links. This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

12 years ago, the 1st generation iPad mini offered a 7.9 inch screen for just $329 with [impressive specifications for the times](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111978).

[https://www.techmeme.com/121023/p40#a121023p40](https://www.techmeme.com/121023/p40#a121023p40)

Today, Apple has grown the iPad mini screen a bit and the price along with it but [the current specifications are absolutely astonishing by comparison](https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/specs/).

When it rains, it pours and I am unable to say “done” with my updates to [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) delegate notes. Worst case scenario, I’ll publish prior to arriving for [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) this week.

Two stories that caught me eye this week:
* Google inches towards power from small modular reactors. ⚛️ ☢️
* Amazon inches towards funding small modular reactors. ⚛️ ☢️

This makes sense. It was just a few months ago that press coverage of increasingly nuclear power options were imminent.

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.<h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4>

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.<h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4>
