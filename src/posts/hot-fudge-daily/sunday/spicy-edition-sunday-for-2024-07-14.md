<h1>Spicy Edition Sunday for 2024-07-14</h1>

Welcome to 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday!

Uncover the spicy inspiration behind this week's Fudge Sunday edition, packed with deep links and fresh insights. 🔥

As a quick reminder, longer form [Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org/) topics are posted weekly on at [https://fudge.org/](https://fudge.org/).

One challenge of writing a daily newsletter is that a lot can happen in 24 hours. While there is much I could share, I’ll adhere to my charter as a personal outlet for writing about technology and related news that I believe deserves attention. 

To that end, I’m sharing a link to [The Breaking News Consumer’s Handbook](https://www.wnyc.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-pdf/). The handbook image is now a decade old but is arguably more important today as increasingly rapid dissemination of highly automated and non-human generated information online spreads quickly with little or no vetting mechanisms.

By next month [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) will become a funnel to drive more traffic to [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) newsletter with automated sponsorship management via Buttondown. At that point, I will reclaim [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) for blogging in ways that do not carry over easily to email.

This week, the digest is powered by [Buttondown API and python scripts](https://github.com/JayCuthrell/buttondown-python-scripts).

Analyzing the past and future of the tech market in Markets Monday.<h2>Last week</h2>

Looking at the week behind for the tech market.

I typically ask Siri how NASDAQ is doing and wait to hear it if is a big change or not. Siri logic on the definition of what to say if the there is +/- < 1% seems to be varied by day of attempts. More experimentation or going deeper into how Siri makes word choices will be interesting as the new Apple WWDC stories of Siri evolve over the year.

Previously, I mentioned adding a 5 day view contrasted with a 5 year view.

[![5 day view](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/fd2f8e67-3098-4a7d-8514-551b38813fb2.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?&window=5D)
*5 day view*

Last week I made an error by showing only a 1D view vs. a 5D view. This is where automation would be handy so that at least errors would be consistent and correctable for the future.

[![5 year view](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/9ad65b31-a574-4feb-ad95-a9a69b7d5c0e.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?window=5Y)
*5 year view*

And again, “this seems to be going up for now”, is still true on a long enough timeline.<h2>This week</h2>

Looking at the week ahead for the tech market.

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.

The winners list last narrowed from five to… two.

*Heat Map view last week*

This week an expansion where the two went to fifteen. However, looking back, I made an error last week in going in before the bell. Lesson learned.

{{ subscribe_form }}<h1>Throwback Thursday for 2024-07-11</h1>

Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

[https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/)

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet. As I come across Twitter URLs in my newsletter archive, I am finding that the change in Twitter ownership, degradation of URLs (link rot), and the transition between different newsletter platforms has made much of this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

For example, if you were to look back 5 years and analyze press coverage of the all things cloud, you’d probably have waved off any concerns for A.I… bubble or not.

[Cloudflare](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NET/) - At just 15 years of age, this teenage titan of the cloud has made a big impact by simply not being AWS, Azure, GCP, or any other hyperscale cloud service provider — they are truly their own thing. From early protections from DDoS attacks from bot nets running on compromised PCs on residential broadband, the additions of similar protections from similar bots (likely running on AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) scraping websites for data to feed into A.I. models has been an interesting turn of events in the industry.

Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.

The weekly coffee meetup series change of plans ran into tourist overflow and might come back in the Fall. Cru is right next door to The Vault and is also very busy for a Friday Coffee in July. Another lesson learned: If the event has coffee in the name… consider three alternative coffee houses.

This week, I continued the [Hot Fudge Daily](https://fudge.org/) digest posted in [🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday](https://fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-07-07/) as “free” weekly content.

Next month, [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) should have Google Adsense enabled which I last experimented with over a decade ago. However, for users browsing with ad blockers there won’t be one of those annoying “please turn off your ad blocker” messages.

I am still getting prepared for traffic to [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) newsletter automated sponsorship management via Buttondown. I have another sponsor that will go live in August as well.

My original 11ty version and opinionated starter for [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) will be going through major revisions. 11ty is close to reaching 3.x and I’ve been fine with earlier releases but want to get the advantages of what 3.x brings.

Mastodon continues to be an interesting experiment and I think that LinkedIn might be worth continuing to publish to but not as a newsletter platform. I believe that my LinkedIn Newsletter(s) experimentation will be to drive traffic elsewhere which is contrary to LinkedIn goals of being a walled garden. 🤷‍♂️

With the eventual reclamation of [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) and [cuthrell.com](http://cuthrell.com) in my roadmap, I continue noodling on using [qthrul.com](http://qthrul.com) aka QTHRUL CORP as a holding site for [cuthrell.consulting](http://cuthrell.consulting) and anchor for [cuthrell.net](http://cuthrell.net) and [cuthrell.org](http://cuthrell.org).

Unveiling overlooked tech news with a sprinkle of satire.<h2 style="text-align: start">Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h2>

Yes, a play on words.

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.<h2 style="text-align: start">Why Sneak Peak?</h2>

It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week. Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday. Or, in the case of a long holiday week.<h2>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h2>
