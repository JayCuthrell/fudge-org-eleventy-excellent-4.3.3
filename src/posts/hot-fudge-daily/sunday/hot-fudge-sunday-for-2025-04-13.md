## Reminder

[AI Infrastructure Field Day 2](https://techfieldday.com/event/aiifd2/) is just a week away!

https://techfieldday.com/event/aiifd2/

## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). I have participated in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) for a year since leaving IBM, rebooting [Cuthrell Consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting), and [joining NexusTek](https://cuthrell.consulting/blog/jay-cuthrell-joins-nexustek/).

This week was my first week without a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) to join. In truth, for the past few months I was missing [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) meetings.

My work travel time commitments were starting to turn me into that person that is on the invite but doesn't show. Even if I like to think that's not me, I learned a lesson about availability.

Since late last year, I’ve also been highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. This week I’m simplifying as the About section updates were not getting updated (by me) in a timely fashion.

Week over week, the list grew until I had to add an Alumni 🎉 section this week for those that have transitioned from [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) to their next career adventure.

## 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-04-07
 
<p>As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…</p><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3><p>For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.</p><p>Last week:</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/7f2ff0ed-b915-4f1e-b32c-bd3e4ae57823.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Not so spicy returns" draggable="false"><figcaption>Not so spicy returns</figcaption></figure><p>This week:</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/863e15f8-24e9-4d9e-91d2-afe42fbb6ad8.png?w=960&amp;fit=max)" alt="Spicy Level 19!" draggable="false"><figcaption>Spicy Level 19!</figcaption></figure><p>Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.</p><p>If you are using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/">Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks</a> screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.</p><ul><li><p>% Change in Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than 4</strong></p></li><li><p>Region: <strong>United States</strong></p></li><li><p>Market Cap (Intraday): <strong>Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap</strong></p></li><li><p>Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than or equal 5</strong></p></li><li><p>Volume:<strong>greater than 15000</strong></p></li><li><p>Sector: <strong>Technology</strong></p></li><li><p>Industry: <strong>Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics &amp; Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific &amp; Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment &amp; Materials and Semiconductors</strong></p></li></ul>
   
## 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2025-04-08
 
Tariffs Tuesday? I'll let other newsletters handle that...

Two hot takes on funding on Tuesday.

🛜 + 💰 I am a happy long time Tailscale customer and this is pleasing to see as they are the only exception I have to saying VPN stands for Vexing Productivity Neutralizer.

https://www.techmeme.com/250408/p12#a250408p12
 
🤖 + 💰 I am reminded of [Mr. Rogers looking for the helpers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LGHtc_D328) among the increasingly dystopian drone warfare landscape.

## 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2025-04-09
 
Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-04-10
 
<p>One headline for Thursday Throwback caught my eye.</p><p>🧂 + 🛜 The herd of packets has been heard.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250410/p39#a250410p39">https://www.techmeme.com/250410/p39#a250410p39</a></p><p>Previously… Salt Typhoon was seemingly a blip in the news because some other shiny object squirrels appeared to knock it out of the headlines.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250122/p3#a250122p3">https://www.techmeme.com/250122/p3#a250122p3</a></p><p>Why Typhoon?

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-04-11
 
The story that caught my eye this week was Agent2Agent (A2A).

https://www.techmeme.com/250409/p42#a250409p42

If you haven't heard buzz around Model Context Protocol (MCP) then I'll try making this a cooking contest television show.

MCP would be like different chefs competing on a cooking contest show. It's entertaining but the chefs are focused on their unique recipes and making their courses unique.

A2A would be like getting different chefs to be able to collaborate as a team for the best meal possible within a budget that considers dietary restrictions. It's not just entertaining — it's arguably going to result in a better and more complete meal experience that seeks the culinary experience optima.
   
## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-04-12
 
<p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.</p><h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4><p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><p>In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.</p><h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250411/p20#a250411p20">https://www.techmeme.com/250411/p20#a250411p20</a></p><h4>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250411/p13#a250411p13">https://www.techmeme.com/250411/p13#a250411p13</a></p><h4>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250411/p10#a250411p10">https://www.techmeme.com/250411/p10#a250411p10</a></p><h4>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250411/p1#a250411p1">https://www.techmeme.com/250411/p1#a250411p1</a></p><h4>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250411/p16#a250411p16">https://www.techmeme.com/250411/p16#a250411p16</a></p>
