# Hot Fudge Daily Digest

Last week, I recovered from the prior week in Las Vegas at [Gartner IT Infrastructure, Operations & Cloud Strategies (IOCS) Conference](https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/infrastructure-operations-cloud-us). It was fun comparing notes with my [NexusTek](https://nexustek.com/) peers and attending post-event deeper dive meetings with Gartner analysts to discuss [Agentic AI](https://fudge.org/topics/agenticai/). 🔮🤖☁️🔐

### 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-12-16

As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…

### Quick Recap

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week…

[![Not as many green things](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/54b12512-6b18-4b04-923b-d536607da93c.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://fudge.org/)
*Not as many green things*

This week, Yahoo Screener is now part of “Research Hub” which... appears to have changed the layout options…

[![So long green things layout…](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b2fea2d8-0e6a-4942-a0bc-002b8e1399bb.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/9bda6c7b-fe9e-41ca-9da9-e281a4a9889a/)
*So long green things layout…*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
* % Change in Price (Intraday):**greater than 4**
* Region: **United States**
* Market Cap (Intraday): **Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap**
* Price (Intraday):**greater than or equal 5**
* Volume:**greater than 15000**
* Sector: **Technology**
* Industry: **Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics & Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific & Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials and Semiconductors**

### 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-12-17

Two hot takes on one story that caught my eye on Tuesday.

💰 + 📊 No matter what you think is an impressive raise in the past... [this tops them all](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/largest-funding-deal-2024-databricks/). Amazing.

💰 + 🤖 When you consider how important it will be for the next wave of data-driven business to embrace embeddings of actionable intelligence — it highlights why the need to extract actionable insights is critical. If the rest of the 2020s play out to favor the companies that make better informed and timely data-driven decisions, it is likely Databricks will play an outsized role in the success of those companies that utilize these capabilities to their advantage.

### 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2024-12-18

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-12-19

What happens when the web forgets?

[https://www.techmeme.com/241219/p15#a241219p15](https://www.techmeme.com/241219/p15#a241219p15)

Just over a decade ago, a similar story played out in the press.

[https://www.techmeme.com/130923/p54#a130923p54](https://www.techmeme.com/130923/p54#a130923p54)

Even Wikipedia recognizes link rot as important.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)

Indeed, I’ve even written about link rot enough to create a topic / tag.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-12-20

The tech news story that caught my eye this week was that Second Life… is still around and thriving?

[https://www.techmeme.com/241220/p9#a241220p9](https://www.techmeme.com/241220/p9#a241220p9)

In my early years going to SXSW, I remember seeing [Life 2.0](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1518809/) back in 2010. At the time, Second Life was something I knew about but never fully grasped — much like many aspects of the wider Internet culture.

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-12-21

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.

#### Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
