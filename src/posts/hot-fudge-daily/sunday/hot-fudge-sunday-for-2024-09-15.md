### 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-09

### Reading Recommendation

The technology market can be hard to keep up with and if you aren’t reading [Spyglass](https://spyglass.org/), you should be. As for why, the writer behind [Spyglass](https://spyglass.org/) is [M.G. Siegler](https://mgsiegler.com/about).

### Quick Recap

As a Market Monday reminder and recap, what I try to do each week is look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple yahoo finance webpage. It’s not much but it’s how I look at things and this is what I saw today after the bell closed.

[![Markets Monday for 2024-09-09](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/49c668e8-a834-4063-ba04-66b4b05f6c5e.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*Lots of green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-09*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.

### 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-09-10
 

The numbers this week are big numbers.

The numbers are also spread across funds, funding, and M&A.

These five stories caught my eye.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240909/p5#a240909p5](https://www.techmeme.com/240909/p5#a240909p5)

💰 + 🤖 That is a lot of capital to deploy and I wonder if this means Graphcore adjacent companies within the EU will see new infusions soon.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240904/p27#a240904p27](https://www.techmeme.com/240904/p27#a240904p27)

💰 + 🤖 The Happy Fun Ball skit from SNL comes to mind but you have to wonder if adding the word “safe” to the name will jinx it.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240909/p10#a240909p10](https://www.techmeme.com/240909/p10#a240909p10)

💰 + 💳 Stripe continues to defy patterns and I can’t wait to see what happens next even if what happens has nothing to do with IPOs.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240909/p6#a240909p6](https://www.techmeme.com/240909/p6#a240909p6)

💰 + 🍪 The balkanization and supply chain resilience around silicon is going to alter our understandings of “[cheap as chips](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-sunday-cheap-as-chips-in-2022/)” and just how far intelligence will press to the edge of the network. 

[https://www.techmeme.com/240910/p12#a240910p12](https://www.techmeme.com/240910/p12#a240910p12)

💰 + 🤖 Considering that agentic A.I. is already shifting to repackaging as “useful” A.I., these funding levels are probably in line with the expectations and burn rate that will be required to realize even 10% of those expectations.

### 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2024-09-11
 
Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-09-12
 
Telecom and the .com boom (and bust) days were part of [my early career](https://fudge.org/archive/and-for-my-next-trick/). 25 years ago, I was able to participate in an early approximation of a “cloud” by Intel that was called an Application Service Provider (ASP).

Yes. Intel.

In late 1999, [Intel got into the web hosting business](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/1999/CN092899.htm) by launching Intel Online Services (IOS).

See if this part sounds familiar:

> **Second-Generation Hosting**  
> Intel Online Services' main focus is its second-generation hosting, in which standard, hardware and software is integrated, validated, and managed by Intel Online Services. Using this approach, Intel Online Services provides not just the building, power and network connection - called co-location hosting - but also the servers, operating system software and basic applications. By providing and managing this second-generation hardware and software platform, Intel Online Services can offer a higher degree of predictability and reliability. This can also reduce the cost for customers, since they don't have to hire IT staffs, buy computers, configure software, or carry out other costly tasks. Intel Online Services, Inc., is an Intel subsidiary that intends to be a leading supplier of hosted Internet services, business applications, and e-Commerce services worldwide.

Source: [Intel News Release, 2000](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/in040400.htm)

By 2000, IOS announced it would allocate $1B to bring [10 Internet Data Centers (IDCs)](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/in040400.htm) online.

By early 2002, IOS had signed customers with iconic brands such as Sony, eBay, BP, Tour de France, EMI, MSN, American Stock Exchange, Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, BBC,  and others with partners like EMC that provided technology for hosting “[multiple terabytes of storage](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/cn112700.htm)” that seem rather quaint today but was bleeding edge a quarter century ago.

However, life moves fast and so did the .com boom. By late 2002, [IOS was no more](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2002/20020618corp.htm).

Of course “cloud” became wildly successful. Even conservative projections easily cross over into the trillions ($T) for the “cloud” market.

Today, A.I. is taking up a lot of the conversations about “cloud”.

Lately, Intel has apparently been finding what else to shed.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-09-13
 
As of this update, my delegate duties at [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/) are done but my notes will be published in the coming days / weeks. Over three days, I and fellow delegates took in updates from Keysight, Integrail, Cisco, VMware, Elastic, Arista, and Enfabrica *as well as* a Delegate Ignite Talk series and Delegate Roundtable!

> I would like to give a HUGE shout out to the team that makes Tech Field Day possible and to Futurum Group as well the sponsoring companies for making the event possible. 🙏 🙏 🙏

What’s next?

1.  [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/) in Portland October 1-4, 2024
2.  [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) in Silicon Valley October 23-25, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
3.  [All Things Open](https://2024.allthingsopen.org/) in Raleigh October 27-29, 2024 for [CLS](https://allthingsopen.org/events/community-leadership-summit-cls-2)

Once again, I am thankful for [new and ongoing client work](https://cuthrell.consulting/services/), meeting folks in person that I’d previously only known online, and catching up with past co-workers. While gym and hiking continues, my list of non-technology projects took a break this week due being on the road.

As I indicated, AI Field Day was a lot to take in this week. I’ll share more once I’ve consolidated my notes.

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-09-14
 
By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.

#### Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
