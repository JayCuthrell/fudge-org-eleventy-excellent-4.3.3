### 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-21
 
<h3>Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things at the closing bell on Monday.

[![A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-21](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6f94b79f-20a0-48e1-851c-121dba31318b.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-21*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
* % Change in Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than 4</strong>

### 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-10-22
 

Two hot takes on the two stories caught my eye on Tuesday.

💰 + 🥬 If (big if?) robots can be directed by CV/AI/ML to do the weeding, will it change farm labor to favor well capitalized industrial farming? Or, would this provide the ability for more farms with greater diversity to be practical? If so, does this mean the need for weed killing chemicals in agriculture diminishes or goes away?

💰 + 💊 If wet lab science and AI were applied in equal measure, does this shorten the timeline to achieve impact from innovation? Does harnessing AI provide safer and faster time to market for small molecule inhibitors targeting proteins associated with certain form of cancer?

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-10-24
 

Back in 2011, the notion of a $25 computer was of keen interest.

Now, the Raspberry Pi is going in AI directions with a price of $110 for a 26 tera-operations per second (TOPS) capability.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-10-25
 

Last week I was a delegate for [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) and my newsletter updates were delayed due to time commitments.

One story that caught my eye this week. Yet another venture capital (VC) firm has taken on an investment adviser persona. 

The likely potential for collisions, competition, cooperation, and collaboration between VCs and Private Equity (PE) will continue to rise.

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-10-26
 

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.<h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4>

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.<h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4>
