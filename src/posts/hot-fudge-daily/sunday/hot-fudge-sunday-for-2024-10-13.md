I've been non-IBM for 6 months as of this update and my clientele has grown steadily. Above all, I appreciate all the guidance, advice, and cheerleading from my fractional peers while proving to myself that even a 15 year break from running my own consultancy is just a number.

At the same time, hanging out my shingle again also means hearing about other opportunities along the way. While correlation isn't causation, I've also noticed a slight uptick in recruiters activity.
