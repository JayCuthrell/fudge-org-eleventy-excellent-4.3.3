## 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-02-03

As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…

<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week:

<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/9bda6c7b-fe9e-41ca-9da9-e281a4a9889a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6b71d4b5-bbd0-47bb-966b-befcc7287ad0.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Nothing burger" draggable="false"></a><figcaption>Well, that’s different.</figcaption></figure>

This week:

<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/9bda6c7b-fe9e-41ca-9da9-e281a4a9889a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/59878b9c-1917-47f8-bc8a-75e9dec972af.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Spicy level 4 returns!" draggable="false"></a><figcaption>Spicy level 4 returns!</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.

- % Change in Price (Intraday):**greater than 4**
- Region: **United States**
- Market Cap (Intraday): **Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap**
- Price (Intraday):**greater than or equal 5**
- Volume:**greater than 15000**
- Sector: **Technology**
- Industry: **Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics & Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific & Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials and Semiconductors**

## 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2025-02-04

Two hot takes on one story that caught my eye on Tuesday.

📧 + 💰 SailPoint was not on my bingo card for opening the SaaS IPO season for 2025, but Thoma Bravo has an impressive portfolio.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250204/p38#a250204p38](https://www.techmeme.com/250204/p38#a250204p38)

In fact, this is arguably a pretty rapid turnaround considering all the other factors since SailPoint’s acquisition in April 2022.

## 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2025-02-05

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-02-06

One headline for a Thursday Throwback caught my eye.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250206/p4#a250206p4](https://www.techmeme.com/250206/p4#a250206p4)

Back in the ancient AI times of January 2025, the distillation meme was causing lots of hand wringing but probably cost more than $50 to unseat hyperscaler-size trained models.

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-02-07

This week turned out to be a week where disclosure, due diligence, or an alleged lack thereof made for sizzling headlines.

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-02-08

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.

#### Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
