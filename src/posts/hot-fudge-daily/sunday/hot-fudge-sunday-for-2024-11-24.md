And we’re back to the end of day snapshot…<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Once again, many green things continue to appear." draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/12b78f69-f6c7-4924-ac41-69cb2cc43511.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>Once again, many green things continue to appear.</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
* % Change in Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than 4</strong>
* Region: <strong>United States</strong>
* Market Cap (Intraday): <strong>Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap</strong>
* Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than or equal 5</strong>
* Volume:<strong>greater than 15000</strong>
* Sector: <strong>Technology</strong>
* Industry: <strong>Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics & Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific & Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials and Semiconductors</strong>

Two hot takes on the two stories caught my eye on Tuesday.

💰 + 📊 Lofty numbers may get more lofty, but getting to a $61B valuation in ~10 years is pretty impressive!

💶 + 🇪🇺 I continue to view the unique IP rights conveyed to French companies as a differentiation and advantage.

Back in the ancient times of… ~7 months ago… I produced my most re-shared LinkedIn post in several years.

[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_wiz-ceo-2024-will-be-the-year-of-acquisitions-activity-7182523881671282688-mGaO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_wiz-ceo-2024-will-be-the-year-of-acquisitions-activity-7182523881671282688-mGaO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Curiously, the same day that Google and Wiz allegedly agreed to not agree on M&A terms, there was another post that got coverage.

For the tech news stories that caught my eye this week, Palo Alto earnings and exploits have also been quite the ride.

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.<h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4>

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.<h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4>
