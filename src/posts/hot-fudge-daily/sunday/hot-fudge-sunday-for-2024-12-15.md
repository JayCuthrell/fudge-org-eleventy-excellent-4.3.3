✈️ 🌵 🤓 Last week I represented [NexusTek](https://nexustek.com/) in Las Vegas for [Gartner IT Infrastructure, Operations & Cloud Strategies (IOCS) Conference](https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/infrastructure-operations-cloud-us). I captured a few notes using the official conference app — which was limited to text only with no hashtags — and I opted for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaycuthrell) vs. [Mastodon](https://cuthrell.com/@jay) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cuthrell.com). My end of week [KoMex](https://www.komexexpress.com/) mini-trip was a success! 🇰🇷🇲🇽🌯

### 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-12-09
 

As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…

### Quick Recap

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week…

[![Still many green things](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/5b745842-dd8f-4120-a08a-9e6d43673cbc.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*Many green things*

This week…

[![Not as many green things](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/54b12512-6b18-4b04-923b-d536607da93c.png?w=960&fit=max)](Not as many green things)
*Not as many green things*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
* % Change in Price (Intraday):**greater than 4**
* Region: **United States**
* Market Cap (Intraday): **Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap**
* Price (Intraday):**greater than or equal 5**
* Volume:**greater than 15000**
* Sector: **Technology**
* Industry: **Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics & Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific & Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials and Semiconductors**

### 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-12-10
 

Two hot takes on two stories that caught my eye on Tuesday.

💰 + 🇫🇷 Again, if you aren’t investing in France then you aren’t taking advantage of unique IP protections — and this time, $48M worth of reasons to consider quantum computing has entered the chat. 

[https://www.techmeme.com/241210/p9#a241210p9](https://www.techmeme.com/241210/p9#a241210p9)

💰 + 💁  If you had told me there would be $40M seed round for detecting sassy responses… I’d assume you were funding [a dystopian trope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzF5VawGgiA).

### 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2024-12-11
 

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-12-12
 

Here in the US, a [mobile virtual network operator (MVNO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator) is a fairly recent part of our telecom history.

~20 years ago, [there was a Google Phone and a Yahoo! Phone](https://web.archive.org/web/20051204100258/http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticleSearch.aspx?storyID=59051+07-Nov-2005+RTRS&srch=yahoo) and even a [Disney Phone](https://www.engadget.com/2005-07-06-disney-announces-disney-mobile.html).

And now… a recent $73M Series-B is making it even easier for MVNO ambitions to be set in motion.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-12-13
 

The tech news story that caught my eye this week was Microsoft claiming next-generation closed-loop cooling datacenter designs will consume zero water.

[https://www.techmeme.com/241210/p4#a241210p4](https://www.techmeme.com/241210/p4#a241210p4)

For example, when you hear statistics such as [AI queries use up a bottle of water per prompt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/18/energy-ai-use-electricity-water-data-centers/), widening adoption of this Microsoft design could mean [AI data centers become less thirsty](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03271).

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-12-14
 

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.

#### Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
