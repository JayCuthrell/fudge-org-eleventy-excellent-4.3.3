✈️ 🌵 🤓 Last week I represented [NexusTek](https://nexustek.com/) in Las Vegas for [Gartner IT Infrastructure, Operations & Cloud Strategies (IOCS) Conference](https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/infrastructure-operations-cloud-us). I captured a few notes using the official conference app — which was limited to text only with no hashtags — and I opted for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaycuthrell) vs. [Mastodon](https://cuthrell.com/@jay) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cuthrell.com). My end of week [KoMex](https://www.komexexpress.com/) mini-trip was a success! 🇰🇷🇲🇽🌯

### 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-12-09
 
<p>As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…</p><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3><p>For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week.

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-12-14
 
<p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.</p><h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4><p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><p>In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.</p><h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241214/p15#a241214p15">https://www.techmeme.com/241214/p15#a241214p15</a></p><h4>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241214/p19#a241214p19">https://www.techmeme.com/241214/p19#a241214p19</a></p><h4>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241213/p11#a241213p11">https://www.techmeme.com/241213/p11#a241213p11</a></p><h4>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241213/p14#a241213p14">https://www.techmeme.com/241213/p14#a241213p14</a></p><h4>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241213/p12#a241213p12">https://www.techmeme.com/241213/p12#a241213p12</a></p>
