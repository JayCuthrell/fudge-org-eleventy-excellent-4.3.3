### üîô Throwback Thursday for 2025-10-09
Intel was in the new today.

#### 2025

Today's news is [Intel's massive 700 acres Arizona fab and the 18A process for Panther Lake chips](https://www.techmeme.com/251009/p29#a251009p29). üç™

#### 2020

Five years ago, Intel was [selling off memory and storage units](https://www.techmeme.com/201019/p27#a201019p27). üí∏

#### 2015

A decade ago, [Intel launched Skylake architecture](https://www.techmeme.com/150901/p39#a150901p39) and some might argue this is where the "tick-tock" reached the peak and then transformed to a countdown timer for the decade to come. ‚è≥

#### 2010

Fifteen years back, [Intel launched it's "NVIDIA killer"](https://www.techmeme.com/100913/p33#a100913p33). üò¨

#### 2005

Twenty years ago, Intel for better or for worse made ["core"](https://www.techmeme.com/100913/p33#a100913p33) architecture, "number of cores", and "core count" become a thing. üîÆ

### ‚úÖ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-10-10
üíä + ü§ñ The story that caught my eye this week was [life sciences companies placing ever bigger bets on our new AI overlords](https://www.techmeme.com/251010/p15#a251010p15).

The big story this week was AstraZeneca's $555M deal to develop new drugs [which signals a strategic shift from the petri dish alone to the processing core contribution as a catalyst](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_astrazeneca-signs-555mn-ai-deal-to-develop-activity-7382454720315150336--VYf). This isn't about saving pennies on lab coats; it's about compressing the multi-billion dollar, decade-long R&D cycle timeline into a high-speed computational augmented sprint.

The race (metaphor or otherwise) is on to see if the cure for what ails you is found in a molecule or an algorithm.

Of course, this shift also means that the attention to so-called "open" life sciences movements is increasingly important as AI computation is rapidly democratized to more than the best funded and already established life sciences companies.

### üîÆ Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-10-11
Friday provided a classic trope from the world of cybersecurity that plays out with dependable regularity: The triumphant law enforcement takedown, immediately followed by the defiant criminal taunt.

Early Friday morning, a story broke that had all the hallmarks of a major victory for the good guys. The FBI announced it had [seized the domains for BreachForums](https://www.techmeme.com/251010/p7#a251010p7), a data leak and extortion site.

A big win, right? A decisive blow against the cyber bad guys.

Well, about that... the story comes with a punchline, just hours later, delivered by the cyber bad guys themselves... and they claim operations are "unaffected."

It‚Äôs that familiar tale: law enforcement scores a point, but the game goes on. This story isn't just about one or more domain seizures; it's about the frustrating, asymmetric cyclical nature of the fight against cyber criminals, conveniently packaged for a day when fewer people are paying close attention.
