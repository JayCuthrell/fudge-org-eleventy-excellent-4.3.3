### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-10-23
It's time for another trip in the wayback machine.

#### 5 Years Ago: [October 23, 2020](https://www.techmeme.com/201022/p32#a201022p32)

Quibi was the short-form video service... with a short lifespan.

#### 10 Years Ago: [October 23, 2015](https://www.techmeme.com/151023/p18#a151023p18)

The US Government was insisting Apple should... decrypt data on iOS devices.

#### 15 Years Ago: [October 23, 2010](https://www.techmeme.com/101023/h2355)

Netflix had started testing streaming-only plans... vs. DVD by mail.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-10-24
🔌 The big story this week was a push to [plug AI data centers into the power grid, faster](https://www.techmeme.com/251023/p53#a251023p53).

For perspective, this would require approvals of new power grid connections for data centers in terms of months vs. years.

Perhaps the AI companies will [donate datacenter excess heat to warm homes in the winter as a form of industrial symbiosis in a circular economy](https://www.stockholmexergi.se/en/heat-recovery/).

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-10-25
[HP is coming to... the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.](https://www.techmeme.com/251024/p7#a251024p7)

On the surface, it's just HP doing what global companies do, which is building products closer to the markets they serve. In this case, building millions of PCs in Saudi Arabia for export to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

However, this Friday news dump timing makes more sense as the entire political narrative in the US is focused on bringing high-tech manufacturing *back* to American soil. Still, for a flagship American company like HP to make a major manufacturing announcement *outside* the US is a daring move against the current political grain even on a slow news Friday.
