For Market Monday, I must acknowledge the moment. Yes, this week saw the Dow reach 44K and the S&P 500 reach 6K while NASDAQ is still around 19K but will likely be flirting with 20K.

As the old saying goes about eggs in a basket…

Back in 2008, the [Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) certification](https://www.techmeme.com/080527/p118#a080527p118) was meant to help untangle the growing number of cables required to connect various consumer digital devices. Then, a few years later, Apple had released [AirDrop](https://www.techmeme.com/110224/p27#a110224p27).

By 2014, “[Kiss Connectivity](https://www.techmeme.com/141114/p2#a141114p2)” was envisioned as an end to the need for the various cables needed to connect devices for basic file transfers. Next, less than 4 years ago, Google Android responded with [Nearby Share](https://www.techmeme.com/200804/p22#a200804p22).

Today, the <em>cable hassle</em> can be the <em>cloud hassle</em> of having to upload a file over a network to a public cloud target just so another device can download from that public cloud target. However, there are a few more options that focus on cloud hassle free simplicity such as ShareIt which relies on ad hoc Wi-Fi hotspot creation and [LiveDrop](https://www.livedrop.eu/faq) which leverages innovations in computer vision.

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.<h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4>

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.<h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4>
