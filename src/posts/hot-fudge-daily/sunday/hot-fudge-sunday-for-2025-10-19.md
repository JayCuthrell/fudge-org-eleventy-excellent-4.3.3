### üîô Throwback Thursday for 2025-10-16
#### 5 Years Ago: [October 16, 2020](https://www.techmeme.com/201016/h2355)

On this day five years ago, iPhone democratized lidar and 5G connectivity. Social media platforms scrutiny intensified leading up to the U.S. presidential election. The pandemic's influence had shifted remote knowledge work and boosted the fortunes of streaming and collaboration software while some knowledge work companies experimented with return to office.

#### 10 Years Ago: [October 16, 2015](https://www.techmeme.com/151016/h2355)

A decade back, the industry was still processing the "unicorn" era that was in full swing, with private tech companies achieving sky-high valuations via funding feats that defied economic gravity (reality?). On the consumer front, enthusiasts of drone technology learned they would be required to register their drone with the U.S. Department of Transportation.

#### 15 Years Ago: [October 16, 2010](https://www.techmeme.com/101016/h2355)

Fifteen years ago, the "app economy" was just beginning to explode with Apple's App Store crossing 300,000 apps (today that number is +2M!). One of those apps launched a few weeks prior as "Burbn Beta" as a simple photo-sharing app that received around 25,000 downloads... now called Instagram (today that number is ~4B downloads).

### ‚úÖ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-10-17
Ping. Power. Plate. This was the appeal of a data center.

The biggest story of the week was the [$40B acquisition of ping, POWER, and plate represented by Aligned Data Centers](https://www.techmeme.com/251015/p19#a251015p19).

An investment consortium of BlackRock, GIP, MGX, NVIDIA, xAI, and Microsoft in a deal to buy data centers capable of delivering up to 5GW of power is a clear signal that the AI physical infrastructure is some of the most valuable real estate on the planet but not because of square footage or views of the city, mountains, or a body of water. Rather, $8M/MW, is less about the cost of land and buildings and more about securing a vast and strategic portfolio of power capacity that is essential to energize hardware that supports AI workloads.

### üîÆ Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-10-18
Once again, we sift through the digital aftermath of a Friday news cycle to find the story that was meant to be a footnote, not a headline. This week's selection is from Google's 5+ year saga to end third-party cookies with the Privacy Sandbox initiative.

[Paradoxically, it will be Google's Privacy Sandbox and key technologies going away](https://www.techmeme.com/251017/p36#a251017p36) after years of regulatory debates followed by detours. So, enjoy those not-quite-dead-yet third-party cookies with a nice tall glass of spilled privacy milk. üç™ü•õ
