### 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2025-12-03
Trying a new format. Wacky. Wayback. Whoa.

First, a wacky wonderful video. Second, a wayback nostalgia tome. Third, a whoa we're getting older moment.

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-12-04
#### 5 Years Ago: [December 4, 2020](https://www.techmeme.com/201204/h2355)

Claims of [quantum supremacy](https://www.techmeme.com/201204/p1#a201204p1) are part of the news hype cycle.

#### 10 Years Ago: [December 4, 2015](https://www.techmeme.com/151204/h2355)

The beta release of [Let's Encrypt](https://www.techmeme.com/201204/p1#a201204p1) drives HTTPS certification to far more websites faster than ever before.

#### 15 Years Ago: [December 4, 2010](https://www.techmeme.com/101204/h2355)

🛜✈️ Lufthansa brings [in flight WiFi](https://www.techmeme.com/101204/p19#a101204p19) to intercontinental flights.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-12-05
🍿 + 💰 One big story this week was [Netflix planning to spend ~$83B for Warner Bros Discovery](https://www.techmeme.com/251205/p13#a251205p13) to secure Warner Brothers studio, HBO, and Max.

🤖 + 💰 Also, big story for users of Limitless Pendant... Limitless is joining the Meta devices division. I guess this isn't shocking considering the increasing numbers of Meta glasses I've noticed at conferences.

🤔 While I've enjoyed using my Limitless Pendant, the company has been acquired by Meta... which is an ecosystem I try to avoid.

🗑️ So, my biggest story of the week is my plan to follow the instructions to [download a copy of Limitless data](https://help.limitless.ai/en/articles/13004987-how-to-download-your-limitless-transcripts-and-account-info) and [request deletion of Limitless data](https://help.limitless.ai/en/articles/13005203-how-to-delete-your-limitless-account-and-data) that I've enjoyed gathering since the first beta.

![Download your Limitless data](/assets/images/screenshots/2025-12-05-20-12-45.png)

YMMV.

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-12-06
Friday is for burying news you hope people ignore or sleep through entirely. This Friday night, one story caught my eye like a fictional fiery flying creature soaring into the slow news day journalism night sky.

Meta's mixed reality glasses project, ["Phoenix", is ~~rising from the ashes~~ not yet rising from the ashes, per a "leaked" memo](https://www.techmeme.com/251205/p36#a251205p36). The timing of this leak avoids any immediate stock hit to the recent bump and misses the window for any of the weekend long-form think-pieces about [Meta's other burning metaverse cash pile corrections](https://www.techmeme.com/251204/p43#a251204p43).
