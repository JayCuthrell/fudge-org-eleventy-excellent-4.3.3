### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-10-30
What was buzzing 5, 10, and 15 years ago today?

An East Texas jury awarded VirnetX ~$0.5B against Apple for patent infringement (but Apple appealed and won a ~3 years later).

#### 10 Years Ago: [October 30, 2015](https://www.techmeme.com/151030/h2355)

Amazon Fire(d) all competing devices from Apple and Google from the retail platform (but allowed both back ~2 years later).

#### 15 Years Ago: [October 30, 2010](https://www.techmeme.com/101030/h2355)

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-10-31
The story that completely eclipsed tech earnings week was OpenAI's pivot.

[OpenAI is now a very much for-profit](https://www.techmeme.com/251028/p21#a251028p21), giving Microsoft a ~27% stake in exchange for a $250B+ Big MACC (Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment), and putting a potential [$1T IPO](https://www.techmeme.com/251029/p14#a251029p14) into motion.

Apparently, the pursuit of "benefit for all humanity" includes a vesting schedule.

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-11-01
It's time to select the Friday news dump for this week's most skillfully buried story.

Just as the world was gearing up for Halloween weekend, "Chat Control" withdrawal meant [no candy for anti-privacy proponents in the EU](https://www.techmeme.com/251031/p9#a251031p9).

In this news cycle, loss of support for a controversial proposed policy known as "Chat Control" forcing tech companies to scan private, encrypted messages, was skillfully buried on a Friday news dump. Had this news broken earlier in the week, it would have reignited a back and forth news cycle between privacy advocates and anti-privacy safety groups.

Also, giving notice at the end of tech earnings week right before a holiday weekend is savvy news management by euphemism. The result is a collapse of a major mass surveillance proposal positioned instead as a simple obscure administrative step ("instead support voluntary scanning").
