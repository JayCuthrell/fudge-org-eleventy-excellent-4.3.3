This week is a shorter vacation edition of 🌶️ Hot Fudge Sunday. During vacation, I worked out how to mirror all prior [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/refer/jaycuthrell?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email) hosted content (~370+ posts) on [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) and will be collapsing the archives there soon with a redirect.

Once web archives are migrated, [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/refer/jaycuthrell?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email) will continue to be my [trusted newsletter delivery service](https://buttondown.email/refer/jaycuthrell?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email). In case you are interested, I ended up adding two simple [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/refer/jaycuthrell?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email) and Mastodon related [python scripts](https://github.com/JayCuthrell/buttondown-python-scripts) to handle manual migration and a mistake I made with automation while testing.

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-06-26

### 🟦 + ⬛️ One story that caught my eye this week

It seems that Microsoft will be changing the classic (mid 90s era) Blue Sreen of Death (BSOD) to…

[checks notes]

***Black*** Screen of Dealth. (so, still BSOD?)

[https://www.techmeme.com/250626/p30#a250626p30](https://www.techmeme.com/250626/p30#a250626p30)

RIP BSOD (1993-2025)

Long Live BSOD (2025-????)

(and my commentary on Blacksky… I mean Bluesky)

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-06-27

🛜 + 💰 The big tech story for the week was continuation of US broadband subsidies.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250627/p16#a250627p16](https://www.techmeme.com/250627/p16#a250627p16)

Amid the buzz around AI funding, the success of the Universal Service Fund (USF) and its E-Rate program remains fundamental to American connectivity. Since the late 1990s, USF programs have significantly mitigated the digital divide. It is vital that schools, libraries, and NTCA members continue their effective management of these funds to maintain crucial access for rural communities, students, and low-income families. 🇺🇸

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-06-28

I select a Friday news dump selection that reaches a peak level of trope, cliché, or bromide on the slowest news day that may be attempting to avoid wider coverage.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250627/p11#a250627p11](https://www.techmeme.com/250627/p11#a250627p11)

So, while [Microsoft’s AI chips](https://www.techmeme.com/250627/p11#a250627p11) struggle, the past two weeks have seen positive coverage of [Google’s AI chips](https://www.techmeme.com/250627/p23#a250627p23) and [AWS’s AI chips](https://www.techmeme.com/250618/p12#a250618p12).<hr/>
