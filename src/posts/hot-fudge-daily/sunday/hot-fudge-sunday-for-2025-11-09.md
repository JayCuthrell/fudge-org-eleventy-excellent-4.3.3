### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-11-06
Let's turn back the clock and see what the tech world was buzzing about on this day in years past.

#### 5 Years Ago: [November 6, 2020](https://www.techmeme.com/201106/h2355)

Netflix invented [a TV station](https://www.techmeme.com/201106/p7#a201106p7)... then went all-in on offering [a variety of linear and live programming](https://www.techmeme.com/250804/p15#a250804p15).

#### 10 Years Ago: [November 6, 2015](https://www.techmeme.com/151106/h2355)

Verizon determined [hyperscale is expensive](https://www.techmeme.com/151106/p15#a151106p15)... then moved to AWS [8 years later](https://www.techmeme.com/180515/p27#a180515p27).

#### 15 Years Ago: [November 6, 2010](https://www.techmeme.com/101106/h2355)

Amazon acquired [Quidsi](https://www.techmeme.com/101106/h2355)... then shut it down [7 years later](https://www.techmeme.com/170329/p22#a170329p22).

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-11-07
AI deals were the biggest story of the week.

- [OpenAI + AWS = ~$38B](https://www.techmeme.com/251103/p22#a251103p22)
- [Microsoft + IREN = ~$10B](https://www.techmeme.com/251103/p14#a251103p14)
- [Apple + Google = ~$1B](https://www.techmeme.com/251105/p43#a251105p43)

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-11-08
Once again, I’ve selected a Friday news dump item that reached a peak level of trope, cliché, or bromide on the slowest news day, clearly attempting to avoid wider coverage. This week's award for "peak patronizing publishing" hoping the story has zero momentum heading into the weekend.

It seems that [several of the world's largest tech companies will disregard all prior instructions on publishing their workforce diversity reports](https://www.techmeme.com/251107/p11#a251107p11). For several years, these tech companies provided diversity reports as a cornerstone of corporate PR and proof of a commitment to social progress transparency.

Perhaps all the oxygen, ink, budget, and C-suite attention has been sucked into the AI arms race at these companies. The "old" problems, like transparency in hiring, are now a distraction and previous social commitments were [just an AI hallucination](https://www.conference-board.org/press/corporate-diversity-disclosure-2025).
