[Hot Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org) 🤔 💡 🤯 🤓 is a free weekly newsletter containing a digest of the Hot Fudge Daily paid newsletter at [fudge.org](https://fudge.org) in a single easy to reach URL. This free weekly edition is posted every… wait for it… Sunday.<hr/><h2>Lookin ahead to 2025...</h2>

There are many sayings about change. This week was a lot to take in outside of my newsletter.

Besides the grand A/B test 📊 at scale experiment 🧪 of these United States 🇺🇸, I was also traveling and working with clients as the year counts down until 2025. 🤓<h2>Looking back on 2024...</h2>

It's pretty remarkable what Buttondown, 11ty, and my workflow automation have enabled me to publish in 2024.<figure><a href="https://notbyai.fyi/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="https://notbyai.fyi" draggable="false" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cac2ad37-7f5c-4f49-b956-d2b9872b22cb.svg?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>[https://notbyai.fyi](https://notbyai.fyi)</figcaption></figure>

Also, my newsletter expanded into newsletters plural.

As of this update, a total of 150 daily writing submissions (paid) have been sent since June 2024 with 20 weekly digests (free) and 38 blog style posts for a total of <strong><em>58 long form pieces... so far.</em></strong><h2>Newsletters published in 2024</h2>
