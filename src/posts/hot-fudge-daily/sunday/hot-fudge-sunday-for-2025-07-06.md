## This week

Depending on the weather in Raleigh-Durham this week, I’m looking forward to [Tuesday's Triangle Biotech](https://www.trianglebiotech.com/) and hope to make it back for [First Friday's Founded](https://downtownraleigh.org/do/first-fridays-at-founded) too.

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-07-03

One story that caught my eye this week:

[https://www.techmeme.com/250703/p13#a250703p13](https://www.techmeme.com/250703/p13#a250703p13)

It’s important to remember this is the year 2025.

CEOs claiming AI will replace people in current jobs is click bait at best and sensationalizing for rage clicks at worst. Where are the results?

[Surveys are plentiful in characterizing CEO confidence](https://info.futurumgroup.com/ceos-ai-2025) but the same was true of “digital transformation” before this and “big data” of years before that. Results matter.

A year ago, I attended “[Life After Big Tech: Where Are Laid Off Workers Now?](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/events/PP141421)“ at SXSW 2024. Here are some of [my notes](https://fudge.org/archive/sxsw-2024-days-1-3/):
* Trends leading to where we are today
* Over hiring
* Bloated and overstuffed organizations
* *AI and automation rendering some amount of labor reductions*
* Debates
* Layoffs as a mask for poor performance
* *Instead of 20 staff with a speciality, you’ll need 2 because of AI*
* *If you can be Upwork’d you can be AI’d*
* *There are freelancers doing top 1% work getting a 16% increase in their rates and 12% more revenue from AI as their toolchain*

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-07-04

💸 + 💰 The big tech story for the week was “Section 174”

[https://www.techmeme.com/250704/p12#a250704p12](https://www.techmeme.com/250704/p12#a250704p12)

While I don’t think that a regression to prior R&D related tax code will suddenly reverse software developer roster shrinkage — there will be an impact to offshore and nearshore software development companies. US company software related over-hiring is probably not going to happen (again?) as we are several years past ZIRP.

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-07-05

I’ve selected a Friday news dump item that reached a peak level of trope, cliché, or bromide on the slowest news day that may be attempting to avoid wider coverage. Also, July 4th is a great time to go below the radar in US media.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250704/p11#a250704p11](https://www.techmeme.com/250704/p11#a250704p11)

[AI TRiSM](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/ai-trism) aside, a shift in focus to military superiority in later stage institutional AI work means [the concept of ESTEEM](https://fudge.org/archive/esteem-is-stem-plus-ethics-plus-empathy/) and programs like [ESTEEM (NCSU)](https://research.ced.ncsu.edu/esteemhub/) are even more important in early stage institutional AI work. Arguably, societies risk the eventual export of military grade dystopian fever dream panopticons into more widespread commercial application.
