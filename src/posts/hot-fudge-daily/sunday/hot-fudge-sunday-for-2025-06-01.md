This week continues our new shortened format. Thanks again to readers for all the helpful replies and survey feedback.<h2>Last week</h2>

Last week was a shorter week due to the holiday weekend.

It was nice to see NexusTek recognized for a 7th year in a row!

U.S. stock markets were closed on Monday, May 26th 2025 in observance of Memorial Day.<h2>🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2025-05-27</h2>

Two hot takes on the market.

Tuesday arrived with tech stock movement after Monday markets being closed for observance of Memorial Day.<figure><img alt="Tuesday Market snapshot of tech movers" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/50d9ee5f-3c66-4410-948d-434957fc923f.png?w=960&fit=max"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared link.

This will always be a safe for work link. 🙈

🤖 + 💰 One story caught my eye this week was the recent Series A raised by Chalk AI. Who? These folks:

Chalk AI is interesting because of the origin story and founding team background but also because while some companies are building <em>on top of</em> Snowflake, Databricks, etc. it is companies like Chalk AI looking to be the companies that <em>come after</em> Snowflake, Databricks, etc.

In fact, it is <strong><em>just 18 months</em></strong> since Chalk AI got Seed funding.

🤖 + 🔮 The story that caught my eye this week was a tale of two white collar worker realities… the banal and the existential threat of AI to gainful employment. However, I suspect the truth may not be somewhere in the middle… but is instead playing in another small town nearby in an empty lot just waiting to be discovered.

Ah, the Friday news dump. Let’s see the memes!

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.<h3>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h3>

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.<h3>A long list this week…</h3>
