<h1>🌶️  Spicy Edition Sunday for 2024-07-21</h1><p>Welcome to 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday!</p><p>Uncover the spicy inspiration behind this week's Fudge Sunday edition, packed with deep links and fresh insights. 🔥</p><p>As a quick reminder, longer form <a href="https://fudge.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fudge Sunday</a> topics are posted weekly on at <a href="https://fudge.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://fudge.org/</a>.</p><p>{{ subscribe_form }}</p><h2>🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday</h2><p>One challenge of writing a daily newsletter is that a lot can happen in 24 hours. While there is much I could share, I’ll adhere to my charter as a personal outlet for writing about technology and related news that I believe deserves attention.</p><p>To that end, I’m sharing a link to <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-pdf/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Breaking News Consumer’s Handbook</a>. The handbook image is now a decade old but is arguably more important today as increasingly rapid dissemination of highly automated and non-human generated information online spreads quickly with little or no vetting mechanisms.</p><p><a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-pdf/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.wnyc.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-pdf/</a></p><p>Next month  <a href="http://fudge.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">fudge.org</a> will become a funnel to drive more traffic to  <a href="http://fudge.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">fudge.org</a> newsletter and eventually automate sponsorship via Buttondown. By end of August, I will reclaim  <a href="http://fudge.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">fudge.org</a> for blogging in ways that do not carry over easily to email.</p><p>This week, the digest is powered by <a href="https://github.com/JayCuthrell/buttondown-python-scripts" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Buttondown API and python scripts</a>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/JayCuthrell/buttondown-python-scripts" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/JayCuthrell/buttondown-python-scripts</a></p><p>{{ subscribe_form }}</p><hr/><h1>Hot Fudge Daily Digest</h1><hr/><h1>📈 Markets Monday for 2024-07-15</h1><p>Analyzing the past and future of the tech market in Markets Monday.</p><h2>Last week</h2><p>Looking at the week behind for the tech market.</p><p>I typically ask Siri how NASDAQ is doing and wait to hear it if is a big change or not. Siri logic on the definition of what to say if the there is +/- < 1% seems to be varied by day of attempts. More experimentation or going deeper into how Siri makes word choices will be interesting as the new Apple WWDC stories of Siri evolve over the year.</p><p>Previously, I mentioned adding a 5 day view contrasted with a 5 year view.</p><figure><a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?&window=5D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="5 day view" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/8ab8b8e8-e530-4c8c-93b7-77c431cfaa7d.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>5 day view</figcaption></figure><p>Last week I corrected my prior error and gathered the intended 5D view.

For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.</p><p>The winners list last narrowed from five to… two.</p><p>Last week the expansion where the two (before the bell) went to fifteen.
