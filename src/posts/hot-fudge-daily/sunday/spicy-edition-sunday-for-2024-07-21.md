# 🌶️  Spicy Edition Sunday for 2024-07-21

Welcome to 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday!

Uncover the spicy inspiration behind this week's Fudge Sunday edition, packed with deep links and fresh insights. 🔥

As a quick reminder, longer form [Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org/) topics are posted weekly on at [https://fudge.org/](https://fudge.org/).

## 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday

One challenge of writing a daily newsletter is that a lot can happen in 24 hours. While there is much I could share, I’ll adhere to my charter as a personal outlet for writing about technology and related news that I believe deserves attention.

To that end, I’m sharing a link to [The Breaking News Consumer’s Handbook](https://www.wnyc.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-pdf/). The handbook image is now a decade old but is arguably more important today as increasingly rapid dissemination of highly automated and non-human generated information online spreads quickly with little or no vetting mechanisms.

[https://www.wnyc.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-pdf/](https://www.wnyc.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-pdf/)

Next month  [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) will become a funnel to drive more traffic to  [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) newsletter and eventually automate sponsorship via Buttondown. By end of August, I will reclaim  [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) for blogging in ways that do not carry over easily to email.

This week, the digest is powered by [Buttondown API and python scripts](https://github.com/JayCuthrell/buttondown-python-scripts).

# 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-07-15

Analyzing the past and future of the tech market in Markets Monday.

## Last week

Looking at the week behind for the tech market.

I typically ask Siri how NASDAQ is doing and wait to hear it if is a big change or not. Siri logic on the definition of what to say if the there is +/- < 1% seems to be varied by day of attempts. More experimentation or going deeper into how Siri makes word choices will be interesting as the new Apple WWDC stories of Siri evolve over the year.

Previously, I mentioned adding a 5 day view contrasted with a 5 year view.

[![5 day view](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/8ab8b8e8-e530-4c8c-93b7-77c431cfaa7d.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?&window=5D)
*5 day view*

Last week I corrected my prior error and gathered the intended 5D view. I’m still working on an automation to be consistent in the future.

[![5 year view](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1bc7be08-d071-4b60-b7df-f4ede03f9790.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?window=5Y)
*5 year view*

And again, “this seems to be going up for now”, is still true on a long enough timeline.

## This week

Looking at the week ahead for the tech market.

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.

The winners list last narrowed from five to… two.

Last week the expansion where the two (before the bell) went to fifteen. This week I waited for the bell.

[![Heat Map view this week](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/cad65354-15f0-4aa8-87d9-a3fdd325ccdd.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*Heat Map view last week*

[![Heat map view this week](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6fa1324f-4b8b-4ef9-a20a-b638803287d2.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*Heat map view this week*

This week went from 15 down to 13. Again, I waited for the bell and should probably begin to pull in some commentary once this view can be automated as well.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.

# 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-07-09

Off the cuff analysis in a rapid fire format.

Let’s dig in…

## Funds, Funding, and M&A

[https://www.techmeme.com/240716/p24#a240716p24](https://www.techmeme.com/240716/p24#a240716p24)

💰 + 🍪 While $75M might not seem like a lot of capital, in the hands of open platform approach, it goes a very long way when the capital comes from an entity with A.I. hardware portfolio companies.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240716/p12#a240716p12](https://www.techmeme.com/240716/p12#a240716p12)

🗄️ + 🤖 While others highlight the creative GenAI use cases of movie stars eating pasta, I continue to believe that RAG focused GenAI is a compelling area for Enterprise use cases. 

[https://www.techmeme.com/240716/p7#a240716p7](https://www.techmeme.com/240716/p7#a240716p7)

🏥 + 🤖 While Star Wars has the “Medical Droid”, I think it is more useful to imagine your doctor or the nurse having recall for all of your medical history for your entire life then being able to keep the human element intact.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240715/p17#a240715p17](https://www.techmeme.com/240715/p17#a240715p17)

🔐 + 🤖  Money for cybersecurity companies is a thing and it also means that money M&A in the cybersecurity space is definitely a thing we’ll see more and more.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240714/p5#a240714p5](https://www.techmeme.com/240714/p5#a240714p5)

💰 + 🔐 I have no idea if this is real yet but if it turns out it is real then I have to mine up my LinkedIn post about Wiz from just 3 months ago…

# 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2024-07-17

Explore the wild and wacky world of shared links from online Slack communities.

One unique thing about online Slack Communities is the use of #random channel. Sometimes you come across some real gems.

Each week I go through dozens of Slack communities and select the most interesting shared links found. This will be a safe for work list.

Join me in this collection of what is being shared that is wow, wild, wtf, and wacky each Wednesday.

# 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-07-18

Throwback Thursday will likely become a format based upon Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

[https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/)

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding content from Twitter (as it was known at the time) in the form of a specific tweet. As I come across Twitter URLs in my newsletter archive, I am finding that the change in Twitter ownership, degradation of URLs (link rot), and the transition between different newsletter platforms has made much of this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

For example, if you were to look back a few years or even a few months, you’d probably have wondering how many M&A stories would be happening at the rate they appear to be in 2024.

[Wiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiz_(company)) - At just over 4 years of age, this toddler has become a cybersecurity business growth success engine that has reportedly attracted the attention of Google.

Three months ago I highlighted a quote from the CEO of Wiz.

[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_wiz-ceo-2024-will-be-the-year-of-acquisitions-activity-7182523881671282688-mGaO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_wiz-ceo-2024-will-be-the-year-of-acquisitions-activity-7182523881671282688-mGaO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Three months later… a possible shot and chaser.

# ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-07-19

Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.

*(The *[elephant in the room is blue](https://www.techmeme.com/240719/p2#a240719p2)* and it is a Friday when I write this update. So, I’ll update that topic in 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday.)*

I’ve committed to four events for the remainder of this year. I’ve also submitted a final version of a panel to PanelPicker for SXSW 2025 voting but I won’t be speaking on a panel but might submit a solo talk — maybe.
* [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) in Silicon Valley September 11-12, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
* [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/) in Portland October 2-4, 2024
* [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) in Silicon Valley October 23-24, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
* [All Things Open](https://2024.allthingsopen.org/) in Raleigh October 27-29, 2024 for [CLS](https://allthingsopen.org/events/community-leadership-summit-cls-2)
* [SXSW](https://sxsw.com/) in Austin March 7 - 15, 2025

This week, I continued the [Hot Fudge Daily](https://fudge.org/) digest posted in [🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday](https://fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-07-07/) as “free” weekly content.

[https://fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-07-14/](https://fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-07-14/)

[https://fudge.org/archive/sxsw-2025-senior-moments/](https://fudge.org/archive/sxsw-2025-senior-moments/)

Next month, [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) Google Adsense goes live. Again, there will not be any annoying “please turn off your ad blocker” messages.

When I considered flattening [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) newsletter via Buttondown it also occurred to me that I could write another newsletter too — possibly related to [unicornjockeys.com](http://unicornjockeys.com) or [unicornjockey.com](http://unicornjockey.com) domains. However, it will need to be a deep niche and make a bigger splash to attract a following.

As [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) will be going through major revisions, this is a good time to think about changes. Again, we shall see.

Mastodon updates last week enabled a slightly different route for default. 

[https://cuthrell.com/@jay/112777041378985114](https://cuthrell.com/@jay/112777041378985114)

So simple.

I think Buttondown supports code tags.

$ git diff -- app/controllers/auth/sessions_controller.rb

def home_paths(resource)
- paths = [about_path, '/explore']
+ paths = [about_path, '/about']

paths << short_account_path(username: resource.account) if single_user_mode? && resource.is_a?(User)

The result is /about vs. /explore which makes more sense for a single-user self-hosted instance.

[![Mastodon default view for cuthrell.com](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/cc2cdc17-aaf1-4a2d-bbc5-18b1a052538a.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://cuthrell.com)

I’ve been thinking more about using [qthrul.com](http://qthrul.com) aka QTHRUL CORP as a holding. That would be a nice way to anchor all my other websites — including [cuthrell.com](http://cuthrell.com), [jaycuthrell.com](https://jaycuthrell.com/), [cuthrell.consulting](http://cuthrell.consulting), and maybe even [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) too.

# 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-07-20

Unveiling overlooked tech news with a sprinkle of satire.

## Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Yes, a play on words.

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.

## Why Sneak Peak?

It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week. Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday. Or, in the case of a long holiday week.

This week was dominated by one story, Crowdstrike, that happened on a Friday. 

[https://www.techmeme.com/240720/p5#a240720p5](https://www.techmeme.com/240720/p5#a240720p5)

Of course, other stories need to be seen too.
