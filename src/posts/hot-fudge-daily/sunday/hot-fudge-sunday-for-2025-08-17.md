## Last Week

I made several updates to the workflow last week.

- Hot Fudge Daily is now free and posted on [fudge.org](https://fudge.org).
- [Unfurling of URLs](https://github.com/JayCuthrell/fudge-org-eleventy-excellent-4.3.0/commit/dcb93011f05c4f32fa6494aefcd66fd592c8cedb) is adding some splash to the look and feel.
- [Buttondown APIs](https://buttondown.com/refer/jaycuthrell) are powering my writing workflow and Sunday email deliveries.

## This Week

Once again, I will be making updates from the road.

## 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-08-11

My second attempt at the screener approximation of Yahoo Finance screener is getting a little closer. More to do.

| Symbol | Name | % Change |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| [GRND](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GRND:NYSE) | Grindr Inc | 7.38% |
| [IONQ](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/IONQ:NYSE) | IONQ Inc | 6.88% |

By comparison...

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-08-14

Looking back on this day in tech history... Let's take a look at what was making starkly different headlines in the tech world on this day many years ago.

### 2025

Google and Oracle trade AI clouds and models

### 2010

Google and Oracle trade legal blows and barbs

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-08-15

I believe the biggest story this week was the reported deal that would require a 👀 15% *(originally 20% depending on the news source)* 👀 cut of revenue that would be paid directly to... a government. In this instance, the US government and two companies; NVIDIA and AMD.

https://www.techmeme.com/250811/p10#a250811p10

Of course, allegations, actions, and historical instances of pay-to-play is not a new thing. For such a young country, [100 years of US history goes by](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/senate-stories/one-hundred-years-since-teapot-dome.htm) in the blink of an eye. So, if *"data is the new oil"* holds true, the future of our AI value chain might rhyme with history.


# #OpenToWork Weekly

I participated in a [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA) [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) after rebooting [Cuthrell Consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting) and [joining NexusTek](https://cuthrell.consulting/blog/jay-cuthrell-joins-nexustek/).

I added those [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&amp;origin=FACETED_SEARCH&amp;postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&amp;sid=TbC&amp;sortBy=%22date_posted%22) from my LinkedIn network to this newsletter.
