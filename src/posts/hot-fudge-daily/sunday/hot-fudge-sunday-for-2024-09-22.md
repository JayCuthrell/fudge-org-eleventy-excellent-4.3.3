### 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-16
 
<h3>Reading Recommendation</h3>

The data operations and RevOps market can be hard to keep up with and if you aren’t reading [Finding Data Operations](https://www.finddataops.com/), you should be. As for why, the writer behind [Finding Data Operations](https://www.finddataops.com/) is [Greg Meyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregmeyer/).<h3>Quick Recap</h3>

As a Market Monday reminder and recap, what I try to do each week is look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage. It’s not much but it’s how I look at things and this is what I saw today after the bell closed.<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Markets Monday for 2024-09-16" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/075adab6-6ca6-4220-96d1-83e8c267177c.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-16</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.

### 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-09-17
 

The numbers this week are once again big numbers.

These three stories caught my eye.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240917/p29#a240917p29](https://www.techmeme.com/240917/p29#a240917p29)

💰 + 🤖 $100B+ is an interesting number (now that $30B+ has been raised within this AI specific fund) and it goes to show that even companies like Microsoft that <em>could</em> tap their cash reserves alone are facing funding crunch needs that require <em>multiple</em> parties. 🤔

[https://www.techmeme.com/240916/p30#a240916p30](https://www.techmeme.com/240916/p30#a240916p30)

💰 + 🤑 Oh. Well. This is awkward. So, from a Microsoft perspective, AI is expensive… and so is a stock buyback program. Got it. Cool. Cool. 😳

[https://www.techmeme.com/240913/p7#a240913p7](https://www.techmeme.com/240913/p7#a240913p7)

💰 + 🤖 Spatial is fascinating, and it reminded me of how spatially dumb our smart phones (still?) are today — I still have fond memories of Fei-Fei Li on stage at a conference many years ago where the Googler entourage in the first several rows had not yet figured out their new Android OS updates for silence settings and it was HILARIOUS hearing their devices all chirping, dinging, ringing, etc. as they frantically tried to turn them off or make them go silent (unsuccessfully). 😂

### 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2024-09-18
 

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-09-19
 

Have you visited [the “Killed by Google” website](https://killedbygoogle.com/) before?

[https://killedbygoogle.com/](https://killedbygoogle.com/)

The reason I ask in this ⬅️ Throwback Thursday is because Google is getting into the passkey management business with a new product.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p28#a240919p28](https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p28#a240919p28)

I had so many thoughts about this that I decided to open my dictation and note summarization stack from Limitless AI. 🤓<figure><a href="https://www.limitless.ai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Limitless AI" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/998d0567-93e2-433a-8293-04e5ff9ee888.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>[https://www.limitless.ai/](https://www.limitless.ai/)</figcaption></figure>

Limitless isn’t perfect but it is helpful for turning 10 minutes of me talking extemporaneously while staring at Techmeme into a set of notes and observations. 🤓

I’ve hyperlinked where appropriate as Limitless doesn’t know (or isn’t supposed to know) what I’m looking at on screen while I’m talking. 🤓<h4 node="[object Object]"><em>Notes and Observations</em></h4>
* <strong><em>Google's Entry into Passkey and Password Manager Sector</em></strong><em>:</em><ul><li>

[Google is entering the password manager and passkey sector](https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p28#a240919p28)<em>, prompting a discussion about the longevity and trustworthiness of Google's products, given </em>[Google’s track record of discontinuing things](https://killedbygoogle.com/)<em>.</em></li><li>

<em>The implications of Google managing </em>[passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/)<em> were highlighted, given the potential for service shutdowns and the domain Google could have over users' security keys.</em></li></ul>
* <strong><em>Passkeys and the Rise of New Security Standards</em></strong><em>:</em><ul><li>

[Passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/)<em> represent a focus on combating phishing and simplifying user account management, especially as systems become more interconnected.</em></li><li>

<em>Key developments took place leading up to the formation of </em>[FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/)<em> in February 2013.</em></li><li>

[Passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/)<em> are </em>[a relatively new concept](https://www.techmeme.com/101101/p32#a101101p32)<em>, with Microsoft and Apple showcasing demos of functionality for passkeys over the past few years. Outside of specific vendors, </em>[FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/)<em> is working on open authentication standards to enhance security overall.</em></li></ul>
* <strong><em>Trust and Compatibility Concerns</em></strong><em>:</em><ul><li>

<em>Discussion centered around which companies (e.g., Apple, Google) consumers should trust with their passkeys and whether these systems will allow for seamless migration of security information if necessary.</em></li><li>

[Google](https://www.techmeme.com/221012/p13#a221012p13)<em> and </em>[Apple](https://www.techmeme.com/220827/p11#a220827p11)<em> have been encouraging users to create passkeys, aiming to phase out traditional passwords.</em></li></ul>
* <strong><em>Potential Industry Shifts</em></strong><em>:</em><ul><li>

<em>Google's moves could pose competitive challenges to Apple's ecosystem, which typically restricts passkeys to Apple devices.</em></li><li>

<em>Google's approach hints at broader compatibility across device manufacturers and operating systems, unlike Apple's more vertically integrated (closed) system.</em></li></ul>
* <strong><em>Questions About Product Longevity</em></strong><em>:</em><ul><li>

[Google's past with product lifecycles](https://killedbygoogle.com/)<em> raises questions about the long-term viability of their password management solutions.</em></li><li>

<em>Despite Google Chrome's continued success, other products have been polarizing or discontinued, leading to skepticism about the new password manager’s longevity.</em></li></ul>

Well, I do think that Limitless AI notes and observations make me sound very negative. 🤣 Actually, I think any products or services that moves us beyond usernames and written passwords on notes attached to computer screens or desks is a very good thing.

I went back and read my transcript and the color of my word choice probably favored a summary that reads heavily skewed towards words like “concern” and “skepticism” even if that is a reference to other perspectives that are not necessarily mine.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-09-20
 

As of this update, [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/) videos are posted and I am wrapping up publishing my delegate notes on Keysight, Integrail, Cisco, VMware, Elastic, Arista, and Enfabrica <em>as well as</em> a Delegate Ignite Talk series and Delegate Roundtable.<blockquote class="pullquote">

I would like to give a HUGE shout out to the team that makes Tech Field Day possible and to Futurum Group as well the sponsoring companies for making the event possible. 🙏 🙏 🙏</blockquote>

Once again, I am thankful for [new and ongoing client work](https://cuthrell.consulting/services/) and [catching up](https://calendly.com/jaycuthrell/catch-up) with past co-workers. Catching up on sleep from the travel means it is back to the gym and hiking in sensible shoes then digging into my non-technology projects.

The biggest stories this week were a mixed for me. On the one hand, I get that tech journalism has to earn their impressions and drive clicks. On the other hand, clicks from spicy headlines sometimes turn into reading just a few hundred words that do not support the headline. 🤷‍♂️

[https://www.techmeme.com/240916/p20#a240916p20](https://www.techmeme.com/240916/p20#a240916p20)

For context, I personally and professionally know 100s of people at AWS all over the planet. I was also on the AWS Partner Advisory Board during my time at IBM.

While I have no inside information, I can say that Return To Office (RTO) is a polarizing topic. However, I can also say that one of the Amazon leadership principles is…<blockquote>

[Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtjBkf8qDW4)

[https://www.techmeme.com/240918/p34#a240918p34](https://www.techmeme.com/240918/p34#a240918p34)

I shared [an update about this LinkedIn “setting”](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_psa-privacy-optindefault-activity-7242142795845500928-PEYT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and [a parting thought](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_im-not-a-lawyer-expect-more-emails-with-activity-7242568537213472770--aTJ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on the topic itself. <blockquote>

If you reading this in the United States — you can [check your LinkedIn “setting”](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/data-for-ai-improvement) at this link: 

[https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/data-for-ai-improvement](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/data-for-ai-improvement) </blockquote>

[https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p20#a240919p20](https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p20#a240919p20)

A report on a report lands as somewhat limited coverage… <blockquote>

So, now do one on credit cards too! 🤔</blockquote>

[https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p6#a240920p6](https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p6#a240920p6)

[Physical Power Purchasing Agreements (PPA)](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/physical-ppa) and [financial virtual PPAs (vPPAs)](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/financial-ppa) are entering the wider lexicon. That’s a good thing.

When I think about data centers (which is a lot), it reminds me that builders and operators of data centers work with regional power providers to secure vPPAs or PPAs as well as ensure all uses of public lands for any new transmission lines, substations, and related infrastructure builds are reviewed with the relevant utilities commission to be consistent with regulatory requirements, attestation of environmental impact including WUE/PEU as well as noise abatement commitments, zoning laws, third-party supplier agreements, and any public-private partnerships that involve permitting, construction, and neighboring community outreach/communications/etc.

That’s a lot. As it should be too! Data centers operate on the scale of a small city using the power of hundreds of thousands of homes.

Once you read more deeply into the topics, there is a case to be made that releasing more carbon into the atmosphere or pushing the heat into the atmosphere is probably a “bad idea” ™️ in the range of bad to worse ideas. But, okay, let’s go with “nuclear bad” and make a zinger headline that conjures fears of people old enough to remember the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 2010s.

I think this is Microsoft demonstrating leadership in sourcing energy with the technology that does not fall into a worse idea category. I also think more leadership like this example from Microsoft is needed.

I believe that [small modular reactors (SMRs)](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-are-small-modular-reactors-smrs) will become more common. I also believe that the projects of power requirements based on trend lines for current technologies need future answers to arrive faster… but the market is moving right now.

Meanwhile AWS is reportedly going to go live with a 30 year (v)PPA… gee… [I wonder what will fulfill that 30 year PPA](https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/33038288/aws-eyes-960-mw-for-newly-acquired-nuclear-power-data-center-in-pennsylvania)? ☢️

Apple claims 32% of their (v)PPA supplied by… gee… [I wonder what that might be](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2024.pdf)? ☢️

Meta / Facebook may just end up [BUILDING or BUYING their way into more power](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/mark-zuckerberg)… gee… I wonder what source? ☢️

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-09-21
 

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.<h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4>

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.<h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4>
