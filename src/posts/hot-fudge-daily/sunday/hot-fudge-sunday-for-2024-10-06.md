### 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-30
 
<h3>Reading Recommendation</h3><p>The GenAI market can be hard to keep up with and if you aren’t reading <a href="https://gaiinsights.com/about" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GAI Insights</a>, you should be. As for why, the writer behind <a href="https://gaiinsights.com/about" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GAI Insights</a> is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulbaier/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Paul Baier</a><em> </em>.</p><h3>Quick Recap</h3><p>For Market Monday, I look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things at the closing bell on Monday.</p><figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-30" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/318287d2-072a-4123-a108-0e7136eb8a00.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-30</figcaption></figure><p>Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.</p><p>If you are using <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks</a> screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.</p><ul><li><p>% Change in Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than 4</strong></p></li><li><p>Region: <strong>United States</strong></p></li><li><p>Market Cap (Intraday): <strong>Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap</strong></p></li><li><p>Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than or equal 5</strong></p></li><li><p>Volume:<strong>greater than 15000</strong></p></li><li><p>Sector: <strong>Technology</strong></p></li><li><p>Industry: <strong>Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics & Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific & Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials and Semiconductors</strong></p></li></ul>

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-10-03
 
<p>21 years ago, WordPress was released and would go on to power hundreds of millions of websites. In fact, WordPress powered my own blog(s) and personal websites for many years before I migrated to headless CMS alternatives.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress</a></p><p>In the years since, WordPress usage has grown considerably as has Automattic, the company behind <a href="http://WordPress.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">WordPress.com</a> and other related companies offering WordPress services. And lately… things are getting a bit more dramatic.</p><p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p38#a241002p38" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p38#a241002p38</a></p><p></p>

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-10-04
 
<p>Travel changes this week mean I am still updating my <a href="https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AI Field Day 5</a> delegate notes that sit in my drafts pile to be published. Due to the travel changes, I also missed out on Monktoberfest (again!) but I am thankful for the amazing organizers that helped me find a way to give back in my absence.</p><p>Two big numbers stories that caught me eye this week:</p><ul><li><p>For perspective, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">3.8 Tbps</a> is Terabits per second per second (i.e. trillions)… and is equivalent of fully saturating a 32 port 100G Ethernet LAN switch with traffic… and then adding even more traffic on top… but now, imagine that traffic flowing over the Internet to one place every second. My math might be off but that’s like sending two dozen compressed text copies of Wikipedia… every second… or if you double-side printed the compressed text copies of Wikipedia as wartime payload… that would be like three Iowa-class battleships firing those Wikipedias — every second. 🤯</p></li><li><p>I’ve written about <a href="https://fudge.org/archive/?q=poolside" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Poolside</a> before and <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">$500M is a staggering Series B raise</a> for the very precise focus their leadership has shared publicly. 🤯</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14</a></p><p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26</a></p><p></p>

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-10-05
 
<p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.</p><h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4><p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><p>In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.</p><h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4><p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p15#a241004p15" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p15#a241004p15</a></p><h4>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h4><p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p19#a241004p19" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p19#a241004p19</a></p><h4>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h4><p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p4#a241004p4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p4#a241004p4</a></p><h4>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h4><p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p2#a241004p2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p2#a241004p2</a></p><h4>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h4><p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p17#a241004p17" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p17#a241004p17</a></p>
