### 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-30
 

### Reading Recommendation

The GenAI market can be hard to keep up with and if you aren’t reading [GAI Insights](https://gaiinsights.com/about), you should be. As for why, the writer behind [GAI Insights](https://gaiinsights.com/about) is [Paul Baier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulbaier/)* *.

### Quick Recap

For Market Monday, I look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things at the closing bell on Monday.

[![A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-30](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/318287d2-072a-4123-a108-0e7136eb8a00.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-30*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
* % Change in Price (Intraday):**greater than 4**
* Region: **United States**
* Market Cap (Intraday): **Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap**

* Sector: **Technology**
* Industry: **Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics & Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific & Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials and Semiconductors**

### 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-10-01
 

Two hot takes on the two stories caught my eye on Tuesday.

💰 + 🤖 When I see $500M participation in an (allegedly) oversubscribed $6.5B raise… it tells me that there might be someone else that decided not to participate.

> [ meanwhile… ]

💸 + 🍎 Indeed. Someone else (allegedly) decided not to participate.

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-10-03
 

21 years ago, WordPress was released and would go on to power hundreds of millions of websites. In fact, WordPress powered my own blog(s) and personal websites for many years before I migrated to headless CMS alternatives.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress)

In the years since, WordPress usage has grown considerably as has Automattic, the company behind [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com) and other related companies offering WordPress services. And lately… things are getting a bit more dramatic.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-10-04
 

Travel changes this week mean I am still updating my [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) delegate notes that sit in my drafts pile to be published. Due to the travel changes, I also missed out on Monktoberfest (again!) but I am thankful for the amazing organizers that helped me find a way to give back in my absence.

Two big numbers stories that caught me eye this week:
* For perspective, [3.8 Tbps](https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14) is Terabits per second per second (i.e. trillions)… and is equivalent of fully saturating a 32 port 100G Ethernet LAN switch with traffic… and then adding even more traffic on top… but now, imagine that traffic flowing over the Internet to one place every second. My math might be off but that’s like sending two dozen compressed text copies of Wikipedia… every second… or if you double-side printed the compressed text copies of Wikipedia as wartime payload… that would be like three Iowa-class battleships firing those Wikipedias — every second. 🤯
* I’ve written about [Poolside](https://fudge.org/archive/?q=poolside) before and [$500M is a staggering Series B raise](https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26) for the very precise focus their leadership has shared publicly. 🤯

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-10-05
 

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.

#### Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
