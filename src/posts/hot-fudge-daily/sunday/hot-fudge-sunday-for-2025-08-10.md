## üîô Throwback Thursday for 2025-08-07
Similar to my prior Markets Monday format change, I'm working on a historical format change for Throwback Thursday. 

More soon...

   
## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-08-08
I believe the biggest story this week was electrical power grid resilience and the law within data center friendly states like Texas.

https://www.techmeme.com/250807/p47#a250807p47

In modern data center site selection, the electrical power grid has become increasingly important. However, the ability to self-generate power in the form of on-site generation is becoming essential to operational excellence.
   
## üîÆ Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-08-09
Friday arrives and the bury begins, or was it stage craft with storytelling savvy?

### August 8

https://www.techmeme.com/250808/p25#a250808p25

Considering the theatrical notion of so-called backdoors, kill switches, etc. the coverage timing of value chain companies (TSMC, etc.) and the expedient outcome (capitulation?) of export policy logjams ‚Äî the arguably sudden resolution for NVIDIA interests is a bit on the nose.

To see what I mean, let's start by backing the news truck up a bit by *[ checks notes... ]* a whole week...

### August 7

# #OpenToWork Weekly

I participated in a [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA) [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) after rebooting [Cuthrell Consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting) and [joining NexusTek](https://cuthrell.consulting/blog/jay-cuthrell-joins-nexustek/).
