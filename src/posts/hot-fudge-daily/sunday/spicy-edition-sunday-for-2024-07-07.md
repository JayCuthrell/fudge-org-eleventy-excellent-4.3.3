<h1>Spicy Edition Sunday for 2024-07-07</h1>

Welcome to 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday!

Uncover the spicy inspiration behind this week's Fudge Sunday edition, packed with deep links and fresh insights. 🔥

As a quick reminder, longer form [Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org/) topics are posted weekly on at [https://fudge.org/](https://fudge.org/).

By next month [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) will become a funnel to drive more traffic to [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) newsletter with automated sponsorship management via Buttondown. At that point, I will reclaim [fudge.org](http://fudge.org) for blogging in ways that do not carry over easily to email.

Previously, I mentioned adding a 5 day view contrasted with a 5 year view.

[![5 day view](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/8234fdb7-a729-4946-bb1b-aca709afeb89.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ)
*5 day view*

*5 year view*

And so, “this seems to be going up for now”, is still true on a long enough timeline.<h2>This week</h2>

Looking at the week ahead for the tech market.

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.

And… the winners list narrowed from five to… two.

💰 + 🎰 I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess that those young startups will have some kind of GenAI angle and the other late-stage fund will be for companies adding a GenAI story.

🍪 + 🤖 Because those chips aren’t going to just pay for themselves. Right? Of course, the data storage is going to be an interesting side story that unlocks innovations and valuations. Long live the algal bloom of niche service providers!

🎥 + 🤖 If bad CGI in movies based on comic books becomes better CGI based on interesting new writers, this could be very big in the same way that self publishing unlocked a massive fan fiction market.

[https://www.techmeme.com/240702/p6#a240702p6](https://www.techmeme.com/240702/p6#a240702p6)

🎥 + 🤖 Speaking of bad CGI, what if CGI didn't have to be so bad after all? If the last remaining cost in prior decades were human animators, perhaps the next cost reduction is coupled with vastly greater output in more democratized means of production.

👥 + ☁️ Wait. There does not appear to be any reference to GenAI?!? This must be a mistake <strong><em>or</em></strong> there is a vibrant market for alternative HR software solutions delivered via SaaS.

🗄️ + 🤖 The best RAG and GenAI demos are those demos which fundamentally alter our perception of what a good search result looks like when trying to find not just the needle in a haystack of documents, but where the needle is located in the haystack relative to the hay (document) itself.

If you were to look back 40 years at press coverage, you’d probably not bat an eyelash for the impact of one company on the current underpinnings of A.I. fervor today.

[Micron](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MU/) - While it might seem like it has been 40 years, Micron has been a fixture in technology for decades since and decades to come. Recent commentary on HBM alone is just the latest story in the history of this amazing company.

For July, I am having a weekly coffee meetup and have decided to go with LinkedIn Events then drive registrations on Luma.

[https://www.linkedin.com/events/coffeeatthevault7212552429198848000/comments/](https://www.linkedin.com/events/coffeeatthevault7212552429198848000/comments/)

Getting people to register is a lot of friction and I assumed nobody showed. But, this morning The Vault is packed with lots of day pass folks and we ran out of clean coffee cups. 🤣

Next week, for coffee, Cru is right next door to The Vault and that will be the future meeting place for Friday Coffee. The lesson learned: If the event has coffee in the name… make sure you can get coffee — so Cru it shall be!

The week after next, I’ll be heading to [Raleigh Founded - NCSU](https://www.raleighfounded.com/locations/raleigh-founded-centennial) in Raleigh July 17, 2024 for [Summer Career Fair](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/summer-career-fair-tickets-884125311607).

In August, I’m not planning heavy travel but it is TBD if I will be a delegate for [Tech Field Day Extra at SHARE](https://techfieldday.com/event/sharekc2024/) in Kansas City August 5-7, 2024.

This week, I continued the [Hot Fudge Daily](https://fudge.org/) digest posted in [🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday](https://fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-06-30) as “free” weekly content.

In somewhat related news, my use of Mastodon has been pretty minimal but an interesting experiment. However, most of my social updates flow to LinkedIn these days.

I just signed up for Buffer again now that free accounts can federate across three destinations. So, I am also considering a similar reclamation move for [cuthrell.com](http://cuthrell.com) to be an alias or do something with [qthrul.com](http://qthrul.com) as a holding site for [cuthrell.consulting](http://cuthrell.consulting) then formalize [cuthrell.net](http://cuthrell.net) and [cuthrell.org](http://cuthrell.org). {{ subscribe_form }}<h2>🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday</h2>

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.

It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week. Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday. Or, in the case of a long holiday week.<h3>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h3>
