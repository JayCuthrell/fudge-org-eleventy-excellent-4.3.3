## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). Previously, I participated in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) for a year after leaving IBM, rebooting [Cuthrell Consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting), and [joining NexusTek](https://cuthrell.consulting/blog/jay-cuthrell-joins-nexustek/).

Since late last year, I‚Äôve also been highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. This week I‚Äôm simplifying as the About section updates were not getting updated (by me) in a timely fashion.

Week over week, the list grew until I had to add an Alumni üéâ section this week for those that have transitioned from [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) to their next career adventure.

<p>As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot‚Ä¶</p><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3><p>For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It‚Äôs how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.</p><p>Last week:</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f87dc76c-45c3-4679-9d0b-5f81de15b0f1.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="No spicy" draggable="false"><figcaption>No spicy</figcaption></figure><p>This week:</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ef06e8db-9d7a-4467-8790-c7e2ee134417.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="No spicy (2 weeks in a row)" draggable="false"><figcaption>No spicy (2 weeks in a row)</figcaption></figure><p>Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance.

## üîô Throwback Thursday for 2025-04-24
 
Three years goes by fast and one story caught my eye this week.

Are you verified? 

By... 

LinkedIn?

https://www.techmeme.com/250424/p12#a250424p12

Just two years ago, LinkedIn opened identity verification by company emails on a global basis.

https://www.techmeme.com/230412/p21#a230412p21

And only three years ago, LinkedIn entered the identity verification space.

## üîÆ Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-04-26
 
Ah, the Friday news dump. Let‚Äôs see the memes!

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.

### Peak üèîÔ∏è vs. Peek üëÄ

Then there is a trope, clich√©, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday ‚Äî to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.
