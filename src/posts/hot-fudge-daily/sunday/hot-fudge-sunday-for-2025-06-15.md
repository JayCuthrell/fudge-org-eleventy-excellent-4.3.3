💰 + 🤖 Funding for AI in search and security continues but on a long enough timeline they will likely converge.

🤖 + 🕸️ One story caught my eye this week was the growth in AI crawlers that are gathering instant results for users of various alternatives to web search. Some coverage uses the “bot” name as an inside baseball style reference to [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt).

[https://www.techmeme.com/250612/p13#a250612p13](https://www.techmeme.com/250612/p13#a250612p13)

As for “bots”, if you look back at coverage of early web crawlers, there are some familiar patterns. 20 years ago, [coverage of Google Base](https://www.techmeme.com/051025/p31#a051025p31) was mixed but provided a roadmap for where the increasingly machine readable web was heading.

☁️ + 🚨 The story that caught my eye this week was the still newsworthy nature of a cloud scale outage.

Back in the ancient times of 2021, I wrote this piece on the theme of [Cloud in Public: Status Dashboards](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-sunday-cloud-in-public-status-dashboards/)

These days, one can easily see just how offline something truly is… and often get a root cause analysis in record time.

Ah, the Friday news dump. By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.<h3>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h3>

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

🤔 🤨 🧐 Just a couple that caught my technologist eye…
