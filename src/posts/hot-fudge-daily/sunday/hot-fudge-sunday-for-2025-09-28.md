## This Week

I ended up traveling last minute last week so this week I'm slowly catching up on ideas and execution. So, I did a post analysis for what would "fit" into my GoToSocial feed.

Percentage of posts under **5000** characters by day:

| Day       | Suitable Posts | Total Posts | Percentage |
| :-------- | :------------- | :---------- | :--------- |
| Monday | 47 | 124 | 37.90% |
| Tuesday | 61 | 63 | 96.83% |
| Wednesday | 75 | 78 | 96.15% |
| Thursday | 69 | 73 | 94.52% |
| Friday | 58 | 67 | 86.57% |
| Saturday | 112 | 122 | 91.80% |

*Sunday is excluded from the percentage calculation as it is reserved for digests.*
*Found 209 posts on Sundays.*

We shall see.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-09-26

## üîÆ Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-09-27

One Friday news stories was worth a second look. It seems that the US Commerce Department is rumored to be considering ways to revert back to 1995 levels of US-sourced semiconductors.

https://www.techmeme.com/250926/p28#a250926p28

To put this into perspective, that's like going from the icing on a cake to the cake itself. Tariffs drama aside, this rumor seems more like a slow news day dump that wants to drift on prior activities and see if there are clicks generated.

As for prior activities, it is worth looking at what I had noted back in 2022 around fabrication facilities. Indeed, the wake of pandemic supply chain lessons was just the early beginning of what might become a trend in vertical resilience in many nations and not just the US.
