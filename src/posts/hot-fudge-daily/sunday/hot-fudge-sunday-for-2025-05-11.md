## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). Previously, I participated in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) for a year after leaving IBM, rebooting [Cuthrell Consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting), and [joining NexusTek](https://cuthrell.consulting/blog/jay-cuthrell-joins-nexustek/).

Since late last year, I’ve also been highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. This week I’m simplifying as the About section updates were not getting updated (by me) in a timely fashion.

Week over week, the list grew until I had to add an Alumni 🎉 section this week for those that have transitioned from [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) to their next career adventure.

# Hot Fudge Daily Digest

## 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-05-05
 

As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week:<figure><img alt="Return of spicy level 1!" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/2373503a-3131-4654-9383-a27635f79493.png?w=960&fit=max"/><figcaption>Return of spicy level 1!</figcaption></figure>

This week:<figure><img alt="And… no spicy." draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/14193d0d-4d78-45af-900c-ed2a3975473c.png?w=960&fit=max"/><figcaption>And… no spicy.</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
* % Change in Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than 4</strong>
* Region: <strong>United States</strong>
* Market Cap (Intraday): <strong>Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap</strong>
* Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than or equal 5</strong>
* Volume:<strong>greater than 15000</strong>
* Sector: <strong>Technology</strong>
* Industry: <strong>Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics & Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific & Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials and Semiconductors</strong>
   
## 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2025-05-05
 

Two hot takes on funding and an entanglement too!

⚖️ + 💰 TAR and CAR aside, an AI revolution is coming to the legal field.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250506/p48#a250506p48](https://www.techmeme.com/250506/p48#a250506p48)

🤖 + 💰 Soon, the “Uhhh. What does this code do?” questions will be answered… but alas, the “But why does it exist?” will likely continue for eons.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250506/p25#a250506p25](https://www.techmeme.com/250506/p25#a250506p25)

⚛️ + 🔮 Multiverse > Multicast amrite?

## 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2025-05-07
 

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-05-08
 

📡 🛰️ One story caught my eye this week — power and politics… no, the kind of power involving electrons.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250508/p3#a250508p3](https://www.techmeme.com/250508/p3#a250508p3)

Thinking back to days when power loss made the news…

2013… [No Such AI](https://www.techmeme.com/131007/p40#a131007p40)

2006… [the day the glitter backgrounds stopped](https://www.techmeme.com/060724/p9#a060724p9)

We’ve come a long way but there is a long road ahead to implicit resilience ubiquity.
   
## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-05-09
 

🤖 + 🔮 The story that caught my eye this week was actually the same AI success story through two different lenses. 

Lens 1: Generic application of AI results in 25% success.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250508/p10#a250508p10](https://www.techmeme.com/250508/p10#a250508p10)

Lens 2: Specific application of AI results in 70% better outcome.

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-05-10
 

Ah, the Friday news dump. Let’s see the memes!

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.<h3>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h3>

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.<h3>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h3>

[https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p12#a250509p12](https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p12#a250509p12)<h3>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h3>

[https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p23#a250509p23](https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p23#a250509p23)<h3>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h3>

[https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p14#a250509p14](https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p14#a250509p14)<h3>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h3>

[https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p19#a250509p19](https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p19#a250509p19)<h3>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h3>
