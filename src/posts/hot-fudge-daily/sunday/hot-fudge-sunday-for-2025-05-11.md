## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). Previously, I participated in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) for a year after leaving IBM, rebooting [Cuthrell Consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting), and [joining NexusTek](https://cuthrell.consulting/blog/jay-cuthrell-joins-nexustek/).

Since late last year, I’ve also been highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. This week I’m simplifying as the About section updates were not getting updated (by me) in a timely fashion.

Week over week, the list grew until I had to add an Alumni 🎉 section this week for those that have transitioned from [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) to their next career adventure.

## 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-05-05
 
<p>As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…</p><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3><p>For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.</p><p>Last week:</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/2373503a-3131-4654-9383-a27635f79493.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Return of spicy level 1!" draggable="false"><figcaption>Return of spicy level 1!</figcaption></figure><p>This week:</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/14193d0d-4d78-45af-900c-ed2a3975473c.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="And… no spicy." draggable="false"><figcaption>And… no spicy.</figcaption></figure><p>Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.</p><p>If you are using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/">Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks</a> screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.</p><ul><li><p>% Change in Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than 4</strong></p></li><li><p>Region: <strong>United States</strong></p></li><li><p>Market Cap (Intraday): <strong>Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap</strong></p></li><li><p>Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than or equal 5</strong></p></li><li><p>Volume:<strong>greater than 15000</strong></p></li><li><p>Sector: <strong>Technology</strong></p></li><li><p>Industry: <strong>Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics &amp; Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific &amp; Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment &amp; Materials and Semiconductors</strong></p></li></ul>
   
## 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2025-05-05

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-05-08
 
<p>📡 🛰️ One story caught my eye this week — power and politics… no, the kind of power involving electrons.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250508/p3#a250508p3">https://www.techmeme.com/250508/p3#a250508p3</a></p><p>Thinking back to days when power loss made the news…</p><p>2013… <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/131007/p40#a131007p40">No Such AI</a></p><p>2006… <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/060724/p9#a060724p9">the day the glitter backgrounds stopped</a></p><p>We’ve come a long way but there is a long road ahead to implicit resilience ubiquity.</p>

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-05-10
 
<p>Ah, the Friday news dump. Let’s see the memes!</p><p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.</p><h3>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h3><p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><h3>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p12#a250509p12">https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p12#a250509p12</a></p><h3>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p23#a250509p23">https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p23#a250509p23</a></p><h3>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p14#a250509p14">https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p14#a250509p14</a></p><h3>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p19#a250509p19">https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p19#a250509p19</a></p><h3>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p4#a250509p4">https://www.techmeme.com/250509/p4#a250509p4</a></p>
