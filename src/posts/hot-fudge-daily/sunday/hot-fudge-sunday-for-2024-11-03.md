### 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-28

### Quick Recap

For Market Monday, I look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things at the closing bell on Monday.

[![A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-28](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/df850b8f-4d02-4989-bc62-c326d89c6122.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*Many green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-28*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
* % Change in Price (Intraday):**greater than 4**
* Region: **United States**
* Market Cap (Intraday): **Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap**
* Price (Intraday):**greater than or equal 5**
* Volume:**greater than 15000**
* Sector: **Technology**
* Industry: **Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics & Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific & Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials and Semiconductors**

### 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-10-29

Two hot takes on the two stories caught my eye on Tuesday.

💰 + 🤖 At a ~$40B 🤔 valuation, you have to wonder if something does not compute… or if the whole point is to amass compute for the customers that will come?

💰 + 🤖 At a ~$4.5B 😮 valuation, it is useful to consider the founders’ backgrounds, recent problem spaces explored, and their uhm… [actual customers](https://sierra.ai/customers).

### 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2024-10-30

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-10-31

Back in 2010, short URLs were still very much in vogue because a shorter URL is a better URL, right?

Not to be outdone, [Google even offered a short URL service](https://www.techmeme.com/100407/p60#a100407p60)… with a QR (quick-response) code too!

Of course, many short URLs services have gone away over the years with the links becoming link rot (or worse). As you might expect, QR codes are not without their own challenges.

Oh… and Google’s short URL and QR code service “[goo.gl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_URL_Shortener)” is no more.

One story caught my eye this week — Intel. It’s a tale of two coverages in two days of the tech press with a button at the end.

First… Intel bad!

[https://www.techmeme.com/241029/p24#a241029p24](https://www.techmeme.com/241029/p24#a241029p24)

Second… two days later… Intel good?

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-11-02

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.

#### Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
