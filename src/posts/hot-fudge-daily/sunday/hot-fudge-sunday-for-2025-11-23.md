### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-11-20
Here is what was making waves in tech history on this day.

#### 5 Years Ago: [November 20, 2020](https://www.techmeme.com/201120/h2355)

The orderly transfer of power for the US Govt was performed... using [a Google Workspace and Titan Security Keys](https://www.techmeme.com/201120/p9#a201120p9).

#### 10 Years Ago: [November 20, 2015](https://www.techmeme.com/151120/h2355)

If you were a cola fan, you might have been in the market for... the [Pepsi Phone](https://www.techmeme.com/151120/p32#a151120p32).

#### 15 Years Ago: [November 20, 2010](https://www.techmeme.com/101120/h2355)

[COICA (Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act)](https://www.techmeme.com/101120/p2#a101120p2) was the latest bill attempting to balance concerns with censorship and IP protections... it would fail, but only to be rewritten as the [PROTECT IP Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s968)... which also failed to advance.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-11-21
📈 ⛏️ 💰 The biggest story this week was [NVIDIA's Q3 earnings](https://www.techmeme.com/251119/p51#a251119p51).

The shovel-selling business remains the only sure bet in town for now. Pricing power consumption is a beautiful thing.

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-11-22
The goal of Sneak Peak Saturday is to sift through Friday news dumps for the stories designed or timed to be forgotten by Monday that represent peak patronizing publishing.

This time, it's a tale as old as Silicon Valley, where the "safety first" mission statement for physical intelligence is alleged to have ignored all previous instructions. The title of this tale is, "[Figure AI sued by its (former) head of product safety](https://www.techmeme.com/251121/p30#a251121p30)".

Combined with [misanthropic misalignment](https://www.techmeme.com/251121/p28#a251121p28) of non-physical intelligence training, this could lead to a dystopian outcome. If the literally skull-crushing allegations are true, this would alter the "[move fast and break things](https://fudge.org/archive/esteem-is-stem-plus-ethics-plus-empathy/)" cliché to convey an even more chilling connotation in our likely future.
