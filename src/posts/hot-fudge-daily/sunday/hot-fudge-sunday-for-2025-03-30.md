## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). I also continue to participate in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc).

As a reminder, per our reader survey, each week, I’m going to be highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. I strongly encourage my readers to view the LinkedIn profiles of these professionals, connect, and reach out to them.

I'm also pleased to add an Alumni 🎉 section this week for those that have transitioned from [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) to their next career adventure.

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-03-29
 
<p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.</p><h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4><p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><p>In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.</p><h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250328/p35#a250328p35">https://www.techmeme.com/250328/p35#a250328p35</a></p><h4>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250328/p30#a250328p30">https://www.techmeme.com/250328/p30#a250328p30</a></p><h4>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250327/p42#a250327p42">https://www.techmeme.com/250327/p42#a250327p42</a></p><h4>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250328/p33#a250328p33">https://www.techmeme.com/250328/p33#a250328p33</a></p><h4>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250328/p36#a250328p36">https://www.techmeme.com/250328/p36#a250328p36</a></p>
