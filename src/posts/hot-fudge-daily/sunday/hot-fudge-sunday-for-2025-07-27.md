## 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2025-07-23

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-07-24

 One outage story that caught my eye today: Starlink

[https://www.techmeme.com/250724/p50#a250724p50](https://www.techmeme.com/250724/p50#a250724p50)

 Indeed. I even managed to capture it with a RIPE probe.

![RIPE probe statistics showing packet loss](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a7f9d2c4-77b3-48d4-aac9-a9603bb0ca85.png?w=960&fit=max)
*packet loss*

 For perspective, a Starlink outage becoming newsworthy (i.e. longer than a few hours) this isn’t that common. You would need to look back ~3 years for a similar coverage.

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-07-25

 💰 + 🤖 The big tech story for the week was Google capex forecast jumping from $75B to $85B.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250723/p34#a250723p34](https://www.techmeme.com/250723/p34#a250723p34)

 As context, this increase seems to confirm that Google infrastructure will continue to get even more Googleier.

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-07-26

 Typically, I select a Friday news dump item that reached a peak level of trope, cliché, or bromide on the slowest news day that may be attempting to avoid wider coverage.

 This week, that turned out to be an early Saturday morning publishing cycle. Considering the event appears to be “mid-July” there is probably some combination of timing, deadlines, and decisions when it comes to this disclosure.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250726/p8#a250726p8](https://www.techmeme.com/250726/p8#a250726p8)

 This is interesting on two levels. First, cyber incidents are “when not if” (so #hugops to the Allianz security and marcom teams responding as well as their technology partners) eventualities. Second, this eventuality reinforces Allianz Risk Barometer findings.

[![Cyber incidents top the list of most important business risks](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/aa720411-0c86-425c-93d0-14b8ed4a4822.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://commercial.allianz.com/news-and-insights/reports/allianz-risk-barometer.html)
