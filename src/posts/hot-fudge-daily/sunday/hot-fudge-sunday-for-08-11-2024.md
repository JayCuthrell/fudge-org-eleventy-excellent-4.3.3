Everyone seems to have decided this is the beginning of the beginning of the end… or something to that effect.</p><p>Or, to put it more plainly… nobody really has any idea what’s actually going on… but one has to fill up the space associated with a time slot on the radio on the podcast or the words much like the ones I’ve been typing out for this addition of the newsletter.</p><p>Consider this.</p><p>What if Warren Buffett thinks that there are sales and bargains to be had?</p><p>Would it be any shock if selling off a little bit of a company worth several trillion dollars makes sense if you believe there are gonna be bargains of plenty?</p><p>On the other hand, others might try to look at tea leaves, sort through chicken bones, or whatever sort of numerology makes people think they can understand markets.
