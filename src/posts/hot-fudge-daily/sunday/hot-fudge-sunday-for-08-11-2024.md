As of this update, [fudge.org](https://fudge.org) has transitioned to niche posts with a rebrand as “[Fudge Factor](https://fudge.org)”.

[https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-factor/](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-factor/)<h2>Series Syndication</h2>

I continue to write at [fudge.org](https://fudge.org) and [fudge.org](https://fudge.org) consistently using [P.O.S.S.E.](https://fudge.org/archive/me-and-my-posse/) principles.

Buttondown and Zapier power my own syndication to LinkedIn and platforms like Flipboard. Longer term, for wider syndication, I will likely use a combination of of [Automatisch](https://automatisch.io/), Buttondown, and Zapier.<h2>Audience Feedback</h2>

Audience replies to newsletters are endorphins. Post cards are cherished. ❤️

Analyzing the past and future of the tech market in Markets Monday.<h2>Last week</h2>

Today was an odd day to listen to the news discussing the market. Everyone seems to have decided this is the beginning of the beginning of the end… or something to that effect.

Or, to put it more plainly… nobody really has any idea what’s actually going on… but one has to fill up the space associated with a time slot on the radio on the podcast or the words much like the ones I’ve been typing out for this addition of the newsletter.

Consider this.

What if Warren Buffett thinks that there are sales and bargains to be had?

Would it be any shock if selling off a little bit of a company worth several trillion dollars makes sense if you believe there are gonna be bargains of plenty?

On the other hand, others might try to look at tea leaves, sort through chicken bones, or whatever sort of numerology makes people think they can understand markets. Think is the operative word.

What I try to do each week is look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple yahoo finance webpage. It’s not much but it’s how I look at things and this is what I saw today after the bell closed.<h2>This week</h2>

Looking at the week ahead for the tech market.

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.

Here is one from a few weeks ago before my two-ish week vacation.

💰 + 🍪 This is a friendly reminder that $30M goes a very long way when companies are able to consider alternatives to NVIDIA such as AMD.

📚 + 🤖 If content is king, then perhaps legitimate licensing of content will render princely sums to creators of content (as compared to overt scraping of content creator works to train models for profile without any licensing consideration of the creators impacted).

💰 + 🍪 Hiring a former Intel executive around the time of a Series D for a Language Processing Unit (LPU) company is an intriguing play and speaks to the growing interest in development of alternatives to NVIDIA.

Throwback Thursday is based upon the classic Fudge Sunday Weekly newsletter sections for "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)". Basically, this is a look back at a prior prediction or past news coverage and how that worked out in the present.

Past examples of "[Shot and Chaser](https://fudge.org/topics/shot-and-chaser/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday)" included embedding tweets. However, as I come across tweets in my newsletter archive, I find the change in Twitter ownership, removed URLs (link rot), and transitions between newsletter platforms rendered this content difficult or, sadly, impossible to follow.

Thankfully, there is Techmeme. Techmeme is pretty great at historical views.

For example, if you were to look back a ten years ago, you’d probably have been wondering how many Google device related headlines there would be.

Over a decade ago, Google entered the consumer hardware business.

Unveiling overlooked tech news with a sprinkle of satire.<h2 style="text-align: start">Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h2>

Yes, a play on words. By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.<h2 style="text-align: start">Why Sneak Peak?</h2>

It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week. Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.<h2>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h2>
