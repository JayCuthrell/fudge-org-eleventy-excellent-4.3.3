As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week…

[![Many green things](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/abf60daa-3273-4075-a837-c9bd8b916928.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*Many green things*

This week…

[![Still many green things](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/5b745842-dd8f-4120-a08a-9e6d43673cbc.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*Still many green things*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
* % Change in Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than 4</strong>
* Region: <strong>United States</strong>
* Market Cap (Intraday): <strong>Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap</strong>
* Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than or equal 5</strong>
* Volume:<strong>greater than 15000</strong>
* Sector: <strong>Technology</strong>
* Industry: <strong>Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics & Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific & Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials and Semiconductors</strong>

Two hot takes on two stories that caught my eye on Tuesday.

💰 + 🍪 Open-source? Check. RISC-V? Check. Provocative investors? Check. The growing appetite for anything open and remotely usable for AI purposes (that isn’t NVIDIA) is real.

[https://www.techmeme.com/241202/p22#a241202p22](https://www.techmeme.com/241202/p22#a241202p22)

💰 + 🤖 Imagine taking $700M <em>after</em> a pivot. Now, imagine the moment when “Google Search” and “Search Engine” will become an archaic reference from a forgotten time of Interweb lore.

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

In a very special Thankful Throwback Thursday, we consider the ancient times of… <em>[checks notes]</em> two years ago when Google launched NotebookLM.

[https://www.techmeme.com/231208/p13#a231208p13](https://www.techmeme.com/231208/p13#a231208p13)

A lot can happen at Google in two years. This is especially true in the world of AI. So, a few months ago, I even tried recent updates to Google NotebookLM. (pretty cool stuff!)

[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/testing-google-notebooklm-2024-jay-cuthrell-fgvpe/?trackingId=GGXsoEnSR5%2BxcTy%2BTwd9IQ%3D%3D](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/testing-google-notebooklm-2024-jay-cuthrell-fgvpe/?trackingId=GGXsoEnSR5%2BxcTy%2BTwd9IQ%3D%3D)

And… it’s probably not shocking that there is some nostalgia in looking back while the Google NotebookLM team undergoes their own updates exactly two years later.

The tech news story that caught my eye this week was the shift from a single CPU to dual co-processors.

[https://www.techmeme.com/241202/p21#a241202p21](https://www.techmeme.com/241202/p21#a241202p21)

Strained computing analogies aside, it is fair to say my hopes for Pat Gelsinger were high. While I never worked closely with Pat, I would run into him from time to time during [my VCE years](https://fudge.org/topics/vce/).

In fact, Pat even made it into my blog post / newsletter twice!

[https://fudge.org/archive/thinking-remotely/](https://fudge.org/archive/thinking-remotely/)<blockquote>

Yes, I need to fix my [src/common/og-images.njk](https://github.com/JayCuthrell/fudge-org-eleventy-excellent/blob/main/src/common/og-images.njk) (again) as the Open Gragh image dates are incorrect. 🤣</blockquote>

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.<h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4>

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.<h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4>
