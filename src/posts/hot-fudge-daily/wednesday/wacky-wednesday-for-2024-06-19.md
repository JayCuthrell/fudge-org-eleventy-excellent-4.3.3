<h1>Wacky Wednesday for 2024-06-19</h1>

Explore the wild and wacky world of shared links from online Slack communities.

One unique thing about online Slack Communities is the use of #random channel. Sometimes you come across some real gems.

Each week I go through dozens of Slack communities and select the most interesting shared links found. This will be a safe for work list.

Join me in this collection of what is being shared that is wow, wild, wtf, and wacky each Wednesday.
