*Sidebar...* I was reminded of a conversation I had years ago at SXSW, well before the democratization of video production AI. At one of those wacky crossover Interactive+Film+Gaming parties, I spoke with a young filmmaker who had interesting ideas about the future of movies and AI. This filmmaker's concept was particularly intriguing: a "choose your own adventure" movie where the script would dynamically tailor itself to the viewer's choices and preferences. In effect, what today would be the prompt is the pre-scaffolded LLM script, and the prompt is influenced by your taste graph (memory) and storytelling junction inputs (HITL). Long live the nepo baby filmmakers in the style of [Dr. Ana Stelline].

I captured some of my thoughts back in 2019 [1] but like much of my older content, the formatting is wackier than I'd prefer. I'm slowly going back and fixing it to look more like Markdown than HTML. LinkedIn has its moments, though. [2]
