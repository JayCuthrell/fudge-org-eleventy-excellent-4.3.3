Two hot takes on the two stories caught my eye on Tuesday from companies both started in the ancient times of 2021.

🧬 + 🤖 Seeing a company like [Cradle](https://www.cradle.bio/) take $73M Series B is amazing and the funding may assist the creation of an [open-source Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) dataset for antibody binders](https://www.cradle.bio/blog/antibody-ngs-data-initiative).

🦄 + 🤖 Unicorns are born of funding and the… [Halcyon](https://www.halcyon.ai/) days 🤓of applying Capsule Networks (CNNs) via CapNet to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) has led to a $100M Series C.

Bonus: Great [Bluesky thread](https://bsky.app/profile/poller.bsky.social/post/3lbrtl37pmd2f) from [Jack Poller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackpoller/)

Bonus bonus: Perhaps Halcyon ([AI](https://www.halcyon.ai/)) will be so successful that another Halcyon ([Eco AI](https://halcyon.eco/)) will be needed to better manage energy consumption used to combat attacks powered by… AI?
