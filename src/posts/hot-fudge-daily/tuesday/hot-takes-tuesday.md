<h1>Hot Takes Tuesday</h1>

Off the cuff analysis in a rapid fire format.

A few things that caught my attention today.<h2>Funds, Funding, and M&A</h2>
* [Cisco now has an AI investment fund](https://www.techmeme.com/240604/p40#a240604p40) - 🤔 Perhaps the question will eventually be what companies will not have an AI investment fund.
* [Pika raised $80M](https://www.techmeme.com/240604/p45#a240604p45) - 🙂 Fun fact: The service powering this newsletter, Buttondown, immensely lowered operating costs by using Pika.
* [Storyblok raised an $80M](https://www.techmeme.com/240604/p21#a240604p21) - 🔮 As I've said before, MACH architectures will likely be a winning pattern.
* [Sword Health raised $130M](https://www.techmeme.com/240604/p19#a240604p19) - 👴 As I get older the notion of AI helping with physical therapy is a bit more interesting.
* [Cohere raised $450M](https://www.techmeme.com/240604/p32#a240604p32) - 🌶️ I prompted Coral (Cohere): In under 10 words, summarize what Cohere does. Answer: Cohere builds large language models.
* [Databricks to buy Tabular for $1B+](https://www.techmeme.com/240604/p27#a240604p27) - 🧊 Apache Iceberg power move and an indication of what is likely to be an absolutely massive M&A season for 2024 (if you aren’t under increased FTC scrutiny i.e. Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc.).
* [Apollo Global invests $1100M in Intel's Fab 34](https://www.techmeme.com/240604/p37#a240604p37) - 🍪 49% stake is a curious amount by any measure.
