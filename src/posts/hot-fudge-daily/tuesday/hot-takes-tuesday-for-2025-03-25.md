(Yes, I’m avoiding [a hot take](https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctabu/3657942692) on [the bigger headline](https://www.techmeme.com/250324/p30#a250324p30).)

Four hot takes on one story that caught my eye on Tuesday.

☁️ + 🗺️ If you can imagine what data sovereignty looks like in 2025, try to imagine a fully balkanized hybrid cloud that is inextricably tied to a landmass by law.

☁️ + 📡 Next, try to imagine a hybrid cloud datacenter 1st tier primary / backup that is 20-40 milliseconds away.

☁️ + 🛰️ Next, try to imagine a hybrid cloud datacenter 2nd tier primary / backup that is 500-700 milliseconds away.

☁️ + 🌕 Now, try to imagine a hybrid cloud datacenter 3rd tier primary / backup that is 2-3 seconds away and tidally locked to Earth.
