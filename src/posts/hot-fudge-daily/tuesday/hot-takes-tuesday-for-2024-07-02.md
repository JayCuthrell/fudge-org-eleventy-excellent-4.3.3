<h1>Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-07-02</h1><p>Off the cuff analysis in a rapid fire format.</p><p>A few things that caught my attention today in big funding and M&amp;A moves in tech yesterday… and the trend was focus on A.I., CGI improvements, and GenAI, with potential for game-changing innovations in various industries.</p><h2>Funds, Funding, and M&amp;A</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240628/p15#a240628p15">https://www.techmeme.com/240628/p15#a240628p15</a></p><p>💰 + 🎰 I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess that those young startups will have some kind of GenAI angle and the other late-stage fund will be for companies adding a GenAI story.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240628/p23#a240628p23">https://www.techmeme.com/240628/p23#a240628p23</a></p><p>🍪 + 🤖 Because those chips aren’t going to just pay for themselves. Right? Of course, the data storage is going to be an interesting side story that unlocks innovations and valuations. Long live the algal bloom of niche service providers!</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240702/p18#a240702p18">https://www.techmeme.com/240702/p18#a240702p18</a></p><p>🎥 + 🤖 If bad CGI in movies based on comic books becomes better CGI based on interesting new writers, this could be very big in the same way that self publishing unlocked a massive fan fiction market.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240702/p6#a240702p6">https://www.techmeme.com/240702/p6#a240702p6</a></p><p>🎥 + 🤖 Speaking of bad CGI, what if CGI didn't have to be so bad after all? If the last remaining cost in prior decades were human animators, perhaps the next cost reduction is coupled with vastly greater output in more democratized means of production.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240701/p6#a240701p6">https://www.techmeme.com/240701/p6#a240701p6</a></p><p>👥 + ☁️ Wait. There does not appear to be any reference to GenAI?!? This must be a mistake <strong><em>or</em></strong> there is a vibrant market for alternative HR software solutions delivered via SaaS. </p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240627/p41#a240627p41">https://www.techmeme.com/240627/p41#a240627p41</a></p><p>🗄️ + 🤖 The best RAG and GenAI demos are those demos which fundamentally alter our perception of what a good search result looks like when trying to find not just the needle in a haystack of documents, but where the needle is located in the haystack relative to the hay (document) itself.</p><ol class="footnotes"></ol>
