First… an observation and a question. <figure><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-08-21-gartner-2024-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-highlights-developer-productivity-total-experience-ai-and-security" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2024" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bfca3f64-fba4-4614-81c2-1a0844b4b22c.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2024</figcaption></figure><blockquote class="pullquote">

By the time our industry achieves ubiquitous AI infrastructure that is as agile, elastic, cost-effective, and TRiSM mature when compared to current non-AI infrastructure, will practitioners have moved on to another non-AI technology marvel (shiny object! squirrel!) or will AI be the defining specialization of the next several decades?</blockquote>

If you are reading this question in your internal voice of wonder, I’d love to get your thoughts in a reply.

And now, back to our regular Hot Takes Tuesday…<h2>Funds, Funding, and M&A</h2>

Let’s take a look at where the money is flowing.

💰 + 🤖 BIG numbers are only big until they are not and I’m curious to see if Thrive’s thesis for OpenAI turns into a unicorn, decacorn, etc. cut down valuation trend a year from now on everything else that was similar to Tiger’s this time last year.

💰 + 🤖 Speaking of BIG numbers, the amount of implied spending by Magic on Google Cloud alone is remarkable and seems to mimic what Poolside seems to imply in their published interviews around A.I. coding tools.

💰 + 🤖 Speaking of A.I. coding tools, Codeium is a unicorn 🦄 now too and the market could still absorb a few dozen more like it if (when?) the specialization around A.I. demands more coding tools for more challenges ahead.
