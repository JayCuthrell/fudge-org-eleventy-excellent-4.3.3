<h1>Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-06-18</h1><p>Off the cuff analysis in a rapid fire format.</p><p>A few things that caught my attention today in big funding and M&amp;A moves in tech.</p><h2>Funds, Funding, and M&amp;A</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p25#a240618p25">https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p25#a240618p25</a></p><p>📊 + ⚖️  Expect more breathless coverage of relative market cap jockeying between Apple, Microsoft, as the FAANG, MAANG, etc. swap out letters or do enough M&amp;A with stock for the EU and US Government to determine who’s ripe for disassembly.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p15#a240618p15">https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p15#a240618p15</a></p><p>🚚 + 🤖 Fun fact: When I lived in Las Vegas just over a decade ago, there were parts of the highway system between Nevada and Arizona that were approved for semi-autonomous trucking.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p2#a240618p2">https://www.techmeme.com/240618/p2#a240618p2</a></p><p>🔮 + 🤖  While I don’t use my college degree much (Materials Science and Engineering), it is fascinating to see how the quest for novel or first mover advantage in materials science is approaching A.I. alchemy status.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240614/p2#a240614p2">https://www.techmeme.com/240614/p2#a240614p2</a></p><p>🧙 + 🤖 Same thing. Just replace alchemy with potions.
