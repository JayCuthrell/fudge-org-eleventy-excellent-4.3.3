# Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-06-18

Off the cuff analysis in a rapid fire format.

A few things that caught my attention today in big funding and M&A moves in tech.

## Funds, Funding, and M&A

📊 + ⚖️  Expect more breathless coverage of relative market cap jockeying between Apple, Microsoft, as the FAANG, MAANG, etc. swap out letters or do enough M&A with stock for the EU and US Government to determine who’s ripe for disassembly.

🚚 + 🤖 Fun fact: When I lived in Las Vegas just over a decade ago, there were parts of the highway system between Nevada and Arizona that were approved for semi-autonomous trucking.

🔮 + 🤖  While I don’t use my college degree much (Materials Science and Engineering), it is fascinating to see how the quest for novel or first mover advantage in materials science is approaching A.I. alchemy status.

🧙 + 🤖 Same thing. Just replace alchemy with potions. But seriously, consider the fact that potential MRSA remedies date back to a time where slathering on garlic, onions, wine, and bile was probably cutting edge proper compounding at the time.

🔐 + 🤑 As the appetite for Enterprise cybersecurity size M&A enjoys big bets status for the next 2-3 years, I expect higher velocity MSSP and cybersecurity related deals like this to continue in 2024.
