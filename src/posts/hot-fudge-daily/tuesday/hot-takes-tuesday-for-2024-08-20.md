Off the cuff analysis in a rapid fire format.

First… a quick nerdy aside. My [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) approved list of FQDNs grows one entry at a time. Better than 1/5 of objectionable (to me) traffic is being effectively blocked. 🙏

*22.4% less garbage in my Interwebs!*

And back to our regular Hot Takes Tuesday…

💰 + 🪖 The amounts being raised related to pursuit of US Government / Military contracts seems to be getting more press recently as software and AI/ML becomes the latest in technological progression.

💰 + 🔐 Seeing funding coverage for companies with “cryptography” in the name vs. *cryptocurrency or $omethingCoin *might just mean that nature is healing.

💰 + 🤖 M&A is alive and well in 2024 which means this pattern will likely occur a few more times before end of the year.

💰 + 🤖 Speaking of M&A, the vertical integration for solving key customer challenges is ***very* *impressive*** when there is a specific carve out intended to focus on the accretive value of the combination and simultaneously widen access to growth in the process for the remaining entity… and it probably anticipates regulatory approval questions before they are posed.
