Two hot takes on stories that caught my eye on Tuesday.

🍪 + 💰 Granted, the name [UALink (Ultra Accelerator Link Consortium)](https://www.ualinkconsortium.org/) might not sound very familiar but the AI work being done for drastically less eye watering prices with systems that are [not underpinned or based on NVIDIA](https://www.ualinkconsortium.org/members) is becoming an increasingly interesting space to keep an eye on. 2025 might just be the year where even the NVIDIA H100 based approaches are [well within reach of mid-market Enterprise and even prosumers](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought).

💰 + 💰 And speaking of [UALink promoter level members](https://www.ualinkconsortium.org/members), Intel Capital (big fan) is likely to spin out… perhaps as something cleverly named… maybe “IC”? 😉 🤓
