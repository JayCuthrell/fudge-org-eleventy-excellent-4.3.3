<p>Two hot takes on stories that caught my eye on Tuesday.</p><p>🍪 + 💰 Granted, the name <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.ualinkconsortium.org/">UALink (<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Ultra Accelerator Link Consortium</span>)</a> might not sound very familiar but the AI work being done for drastically less eye watering prices with systems that are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.ualinkconsortium.org/members">not underpinned or based on NVIDIA</a> is becoming an increasingly interesting space to keep an eye on. 2025 might just be the year where even the NVIDIA H100 based approaches are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought">well within reach of mid-market Enterprise and even prosumers</a>.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250114/p25#a250114p25">https://www.techmeme.com/250114/p25#a250114p25</a></p><p>💰 + 💰 And speaking of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.ualinkconsortium.org/members">UALink promoter level members</a>, Intel Capital (big fan) is likely to spin out… perhaps as something cleverly named… maybe “IC”? 😉 🤓</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250114/p28#a250114p28">https://www.techmeme.com/250114/p28#a250114p28</a></p><p></p><p></p>
