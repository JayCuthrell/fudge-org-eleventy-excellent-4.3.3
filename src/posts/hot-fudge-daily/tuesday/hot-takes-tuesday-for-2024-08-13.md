💰 + 👮‍♂️ There is probably a slice of the funding data from the origins of various Lord of the Rings named companies that could summarize how effective these founders have become at convincing US Government to part with constituent tax dollars while simultaneously claiming the US Government <strong><em>wastes</em></strong> constituent tax dollars. 💸
