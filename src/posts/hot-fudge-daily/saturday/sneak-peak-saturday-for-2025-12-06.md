Friday is for burying news you hope people ignore or sleep through entirely. This Friday night, one story caught my eye like a fictional fiery flying creature soaring into the slow news day journalism night sky.

Meta's mixed reality glasses project, ["Phoenix", is ~~rising from the ashes~~ not yet rising from the ashes, per a "leaked" memo](https://www.techmeme.com/251205/p36#a251205p36). The timing of this leak avoids any immediate stock hit to the recent bump and misses the window for any of the weekend long-form think-pieces about [Meta's other burning metaverse cash pile corrections](https://www.techmeme.com/251204/p43#a251204p43).
