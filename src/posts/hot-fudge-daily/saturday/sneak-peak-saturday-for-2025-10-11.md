Friday provided a classic trope from the world of cybersecurity that plays out with dependable regularity: The triumphant law enforcement takedown, immediately followed by the defiant criminal taunt.

Early Friday morning, a story broke that had all the hallmarks of a major victory for the good guys. The FBI announced it had [seized the domains for BreachForums](https://www.techmeme.com/251010/p7#a251010p7), a data leak and extortion site.

A big win, right? A decisive blow against the cyber bad guys.

Well, about that... the story comes with a punchline, just hours later, delivered by the cyber bad guys themselves... and they claim operations are "unaffected."

Itâ€™s that familiar tale: law enforcement scores a point, but the game goes on. This story isn't just about one or more domain seizures; it's about the frustrating, asymmetric cyclical nature of the fight against cyber criminals, conveniently packaged for a day when fewer people are paying close attention.
