Once again, I’ve selected a Friday news dump item that reached a peak level of trope, cliché, or bromide on the slowest news day, clearly attempting to avoid wider coverage. This week's award for "peak patronizing publishing" hoping the story has zero momentum heading into the weekend.

It seems that [several of the world's largest tech companies will disregard all prior instructions on publishing their workforce diversity reports](https://www.techmeme.com/251107/p11#a251107p11). For several years, these tech companies provided diversity reports as a cornerstone of corporate PR and proof of a commitment to social progress transparency.

Perhaps all the oxygen, ink, budget, and C-suite attention has been sucked into the AI arms race at these companies. The "old" problems, like transparency in hiring, are now a distraction and previous social commitments were [just an AI hallucination](https://www.conference-board.org/press/corporate-diversity-disclosure-2025).
