Once again, Iâ€™ve selected a Friday news dump item that reached a peak level of trope, clichÃ©, or bromide on the slowest news day that may be attempting to avoid wider coverage.

35 years ago, the [H1-B visa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa) came into existence. It has grown over the years as have periodic calls for both greater expansion and reforms.

At a time in history where slow news days are rare, a Friday update on significantly higher H1-B visa fees gained attention and speculation. First, an Executive Order (EO) was summarized and linked with highlights of the eye watering $100,000 fee being imposed by the EO.

My first thoughts were how this might impact offshore consulting firms. In terms of impact, I wondered specifically about the largest global systems integrators (GSIs).

As of Saturday, more news reporting attempted to clarify ambiguity and charitability of interpretation of the H1-B visa fees increase. Naturally, updates behind paywalls and speculation in the open are both increasing on the topic.

Considering the news ecosystem skews heavily towards tech for beat reporting, blogs, social platforms, streaming platforms, and email newsletters, it is reasonable to expect the H1-B visa topic will probably be in the news cycle for a few more weeks.
