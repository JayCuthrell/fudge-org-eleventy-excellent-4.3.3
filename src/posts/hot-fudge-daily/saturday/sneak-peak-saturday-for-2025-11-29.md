While Thanksgiving leftovers digested and the consumer mosh pit of Black Friday rolled into motion, [the futures financial system scrambled and needed some #HugOps](https://www.techmeme.com/251128/p8#a251128p8). Indeed, the narrative of decentralized, resilient, redundant cloud infrastructure isn't defacto and is not ubiquitous (yet).

CME Group operates the world's largest financial derivatives exchange and is on track to be a massive Google Cloud customer over the next several years. But due to the current CME Group architecture used to deliver those services, a "[cooling systems issue](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/cooling-issue-at-data-center-halts-futures-trading-for-cme-group/)" meant the operation halted.

In 2025, a single physical point of failure to a cooling system can freeze global futures markets for hours. Even in our timeline of increasing compute density and strained power grids, thermal management is still a critical uptime vulnerability and we are only as robust as our HVAC design.
