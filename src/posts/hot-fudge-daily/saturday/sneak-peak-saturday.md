Along the way, I’m also opening the archives to public viewing for the first day of each theme.</p><h2>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h2><p>Yes, a play on words.</p><p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.</p><h2>Why Sneak Peak?</h2><p>It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.
