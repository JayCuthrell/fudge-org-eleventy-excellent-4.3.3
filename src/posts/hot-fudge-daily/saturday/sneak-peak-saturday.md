# Sneak Peak Saturday

Unveiling overlooked tech news with a sprinkle of satire.

I’ve been updating the images on Buttondown in anticipation of subscriptions. Along the way, I’m also opening the archives to public viewing for the first day of each theme.

## Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Yes, a play on words.

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.

## Why Sneak Peak?

It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week. Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
