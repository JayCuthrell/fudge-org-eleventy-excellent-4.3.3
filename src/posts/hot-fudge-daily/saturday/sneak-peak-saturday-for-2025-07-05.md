I’ve selected a Friday news dump item that reached a peak level of trope, cliché, or bromide on the slowest news day that may be attempting to avoid wider coverage. Also, July 4th is a great time to go below the radar in US media.

[AI TRiSM](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/ai-trism) aside, a shift in focus to military superiority in later stage institutional AI work means [the concept of ESTEEM](https://fudge.org/archive/esteem-is-stem-plus-ethics-plus-empathy/) and programs like [ESTEEM (NCSU)](https://research.ced.ncsu.edu/esteemhub/) are even more important in early stage institutional AI work. Arguably, societies risk the eventual export of military grade dystopian fever dream panopticons into more widespread commercial application.
