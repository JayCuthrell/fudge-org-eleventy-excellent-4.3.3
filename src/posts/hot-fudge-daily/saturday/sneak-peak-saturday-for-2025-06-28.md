I select a Friday news dump selection that reaches a peak level of trope, cliché, or bromide on the slowest news day that may be attempting to avoid wider coverage.

So, while [Microsoft’s AI chips](https://www.techmeme.com/250627/p11#a250627p11) struggle, the past two weeks have seen positive coverage of [Google’s AI chips](https://www.techmeme.com/250627/p23#a250627p23) and [AWS’s AI chips](https://www.techmeme.com/250618/p12#a250618p12).
