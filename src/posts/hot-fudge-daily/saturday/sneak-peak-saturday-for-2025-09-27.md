One Friday news stories was worth a second look. It seems that the US Commerce Department is rumored to be considering ways to revert back to 1995 levels of US-sourced semiconductors.

To put this into perspective, that's like going from the icing on a cake to the cake itself. Tariffs drama aside, this rumor seems more like a slow news day dump that wants to drift on prior activities and see if there are clicks generated.

As for prior activities, it is worth looking at what I had noted back in 2022 around fabrication facilities. Indeed, the wake of pandemic supply chain lessons was just the early beginning of what might become a trend in vertical resilience in many nations and not just the US.
