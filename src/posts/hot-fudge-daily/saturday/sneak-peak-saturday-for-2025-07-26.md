Typically, I select a Friday news dump item that reached a peak level of trope, cliché, or bromide on the slowest news day that may be attempting to avoid wider coverage.

 This week, that turned out to be an early Saturday morning publishing cycle. Considering the event appears to be “mid-July” there is probably some combination of timing, deadlines, and decisions when it comes to this disclosure.
