The goal of Sneak Peak Saturday is to sift through the Friday news cycle for the stories designed or timed to be forgotten by Monday that represent peak patronizing publishing.

On Friday it was learned that Apple, the world's most valuable company, is engaged in [finding a new CEO](https://www.techmeme.com/251114/p35#a251114p35) per Financial Times reporting. Of course, this may not be news to those that understand succession planning but it would likely move markets if announced "suddenly" on a Monday.

[Yes, looking at you, Bloomberg News "we move markets" writers 👀](https://www.techmeme.com/250713/p9#a250713p9). So, a Friday news dump ensures there is no immediate market to react and gives the media a full 36 hours to digest, report, and neutralize the shock of what would normally be part of sensible succession planning for any organization.

By Monday morning, it's "known" information rather than a breaking bombshell and begins socializing the inevitable. Also, floating thee name of a likely successor, [John Ternus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-ternus-2392b76/), might just be enough detail to satisfy curiosity or presumptively address any concerns about physical objects as a continued growth engine for the company.
