<p>I‚Äôve selected a Friday news dump item that reached a peak level of trope, clich√©, or bromide on the slowest news day that may be attempting to avoid wider coverage.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250711/p11#a250711p11">https://www.techmeme.com/250711/p11#a250711p11</a></p><p>Top 10 what? Intel isn‚Äôt in the Top 10 by what measurement?</p><p>So, everyone loves a stack ranking or Top 10 list. But, the question is what Top number would Intel be now and by what measure?</p><p>So, perhaps, this is more about a CEO with compensation tied to stock price.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/15/intel-new-ceo-lip-bu-tan-pay-package-stock-options-bonus-69-million/">https://fortune.com/2025/03/15/intel-new-ceo-lip-bu-tan-pay-package-stock-options-bonus-69-million/</a></p><p>Surely, this isn‚Äôt about Top 10 by revenue. Even with declining revenue (~$50B), Intel has revenue that would easily keep it in a Top 10 list.</p><p>Of course, stock price performance is a brutal comparison over 5 years. Also, the ‚Äútoo late‚Äù quip about NVIDIA makes more sense in this stock price performance view.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/eab9cbe4-4bee-4a45-a9cb-d62a4158ba60.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Ouch." draggable="false"><figcaption>Ouch.</figcaption></figure><p>So, let‚Äôs look at Intel‚Äôs Market Cap performance‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/59c5e6e8-a416-4bdf-b15d-6b3d8995e421.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Ouch." draggable="false"><figcaption>Ouch.</figcaption></figure><p>If Market Cap is the only measurement, then Intel is well outside of the Top 10 list of semiconductor companies. If the downward trend continues, Intel will be at risk of staying in the Top 20 list of semiconductor companies.</p><p>Of course, even with this Friday news coverage there is something to be said for rewinding back in the week. What else was communicated in the news cycle?</p><p>Indeed, other news this week was the continuation of layoffs at Intel. Also, expect to see more actions like selling off parts of the Intel business that are not considered part of the core or outside of the restructuring lines.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250711/p5#a250711p5">https://www.techmeme.com/250711/p5#a250711p5</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2025/07/intel-layoffs-begin-chipmaker-is-cutting-many-thousands-of-jobs.html">https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2025/07/intel-layoffs-begin-chipmaker-is-cutting-many-thousands-of-jobs.html</a></p><p>While 5 days isn‚Äôt the same as 5 years‚Ä¶ news travels fast.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/13c3e26c-92d6-44c3-aab0-344a310e66e9.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Intel ‚Äúoutperformed‚Äù NVIDIA‚Ä¶ this week." draggable="false"><figcaption>Intel ‚Äúoutperformed‚Äù NVIDIA‚Ä¶ this week.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
