# Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-07-13

Unveiling overlooked tech news with a sprinkle of satire.

## Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Yes, a play on words.

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.

## Why Sneak Peak?

It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week. Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday. Or, in the case of a long holiday week.
