It's time to select the Friday news dump for this week's most skillfully buried story.

Just as the world was gearing up for Halloween weekend, "Chat Control" withdrawal meant [no candy for anti-privacy proponents in the EU](https://www.techmeme.com/251031/p9#a251031p9).

In this news cycle, loss of support for a controversial proposed policy known as "Chat Control" forcing tech companies to scan private, encrypted messages, was skillfully buried on a Friday news dump. Had this news broken earlier in the week, it would have reignited a back and forth news cycle between privacy advocates and anti-privacy safety groups.

Also, giving notice at the end of tech earnings week right before a holiday weekend is savvy news management by euphemism. The result is a collapse of a major mass surveillance proposal positioned instead as a simple obscure administrative step ("instead support voluntary scanning").
