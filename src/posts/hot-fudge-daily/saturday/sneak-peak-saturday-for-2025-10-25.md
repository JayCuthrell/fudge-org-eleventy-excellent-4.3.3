[HP is coming to... the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.](https://www.techmeme.com/251024/p7#a251024p7)

On the surface, it's just HP doing what global companies do, which is building products closer to the markets they serve. In this case, building millions of PCs in Saudi Arabia for export to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

However, this Friday news dump timing makes more sense as the entire political narrative in the US is focused on bringing high-tech manufacturing *back* to American soil. Still, for a flagship American company like HP to make a major manufacturing announcement *outside* the US is a daring move against the current political grain even on a slow news Friday.
