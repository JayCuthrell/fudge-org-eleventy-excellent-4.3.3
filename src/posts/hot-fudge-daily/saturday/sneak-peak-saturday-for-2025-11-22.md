The goal of Sneak Peak Saturday is to sift through Friday news dumps for the stories designed or timed to be forgotten by Monday that represent peak patronizing publishing.

This time, it's a tale as old as Silicon Valley, where the "safety first" mission statement for physical intelligence is alleged to have ignored all previous instructions. The title of this tale is, "[Figure AI sued by its (former) head of product safety](https://www.techmeme.com/251121/p30#a251121p30)".

Combined with [misanthropic misalignment](https://www.techmeme.com/251121/p28#a251121p28), non-physical intelligence training this would be a dystopian outcome. If the literally skull-crushing allegations are true, this would alter the "[move fast and break things](/archive/esteem-is-stem-plus-ethics-plus-empathy/)" cliché to convey an even more chilling connotation in our likely future.
