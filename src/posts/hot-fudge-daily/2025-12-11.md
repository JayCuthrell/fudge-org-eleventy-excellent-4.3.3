**Format.** When I started thinking about what I should write next, it occurred to me that format was a relaxing and structured way of getting specific topical thought packaged neatly. Unfortunately, format was also a bit constrained depending on which format was used which day of the week.

For example, markets don't just move on Monday.

Then again, sometimes they do.

**Ideas.** One of my favorite ideas centered on digesting dozens of newsletters to surface and elevate ideas from the writing of others.

However, I also have ideas.

Getting back to the original *Fudge Factor* concept is overdue.

* **Google Suncatcher.** I would also argue that it is almost comical that [Google Suncatcher](https://www.techmeme.com/251104/p22#a251104p22) arrived just as I was going deep into datacenters in the sky.
* **Upward.** Fudge Factor *was*. Fudge Factor it shall be onward. And, literally, upward. 🤓
