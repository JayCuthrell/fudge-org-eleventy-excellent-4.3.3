I'm going to attempt using GoToSocial's [RSS](https://cuthrell.com/@jay/feed.rss) for driving my workflow over the next few weeks to see if it sticks.

Right now, I'm proficient with VS Code, python, and the prior workflow I optimized for Hot Fudge Daily. Ideally, I'd like to

* Get everything driven from CLI or cron (why not both?)
* Use Markdown that is simple and portable (image processing?)
* Leverage prior python scripts (because refactoring is needed)
* Break up the daily topical (to be more more thinkish)
* Drop the pretense of title's with dates that lack context (because 🌶️ Hot Fudge Sunday for 2025-12-07 doesn't quite sell it, ya know?)
* Unbury the lede (Descriptions become telling titles)

My first thought was a possible IASIP / Kidde commercial crossover where Frank dons a [nanofibril ghillie suit](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/bird-paradise-inspires-darkest-fabric-ever-made) and plays the flute.
