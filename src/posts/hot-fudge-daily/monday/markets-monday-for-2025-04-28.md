### Quick Recap

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week:

![No spicy (2 weeks in a row)](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ef06e8db-9d7a-4467-8790-c7e2ee134417.png?w=960&fit=max)
*No spicy (2 weeks in a row)*

This week:

![Return of spicy level 1!](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/2373503a-3131-4654-9383-a27635f79493.png?w=960&fit=max)
*Return of spicy level 1!*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
