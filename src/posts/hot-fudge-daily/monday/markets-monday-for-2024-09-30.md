<h3>Reading Recommendation</h3>

The GenAI market can be hard to keep up with and if you aren’t reading [GAI Insights](https://gaiinsights.com/about), you should be. As for why, the writer behind [GAI Insights](https://gaiinsights.com/about) is [Paul Baier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulbaier/)<em> </em>.<h3>Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things at the closing bell on Monday.<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-30" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/318287d2-072a-4123-a108-0e7136eb8a00.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-30</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.
