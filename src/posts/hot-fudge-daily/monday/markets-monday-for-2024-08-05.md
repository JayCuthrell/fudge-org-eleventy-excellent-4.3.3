Analyzing the past and future of the tech market in Markets Monday.<h2>Last week</h2>

Today was an odd day to listen to the news discussing the market. Everyone seems to have decided this is the beginning of the beginning of the end… or something to that effect. 

Or, to put it more plainly… nobody really has any idea what’s actually going on… but one has to fill up the space associated with a time slot on the radio on the podcast or the words much like the ones I’ve been typing out for this addition of the newsletter.

Consider this. 

What if Warren Buffett thinks that there are sales and bargains to be had? 

Would it be any shock if selling off a little bit of a company worth several trillion dollars makes sense if you believe there are gonna be bargains of plenty? 

On the other hand, others might try to look at tea leaves, sort through chicken bones, or whatever sort of numerology makes people think they can understand markets. Think is the operative word.

What I try to do each week is look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple yahoo finance webpage. It’s not much but it’s how I look at things and this is what I saw today after the bell closed.<h2>This week</h2>

Looking at the week ahead for the tech market.

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.

Here is one from a few weeks ago before my two-ish week vacation.

Why? I don’t know but have a hunch it is because of semiconductors, value chains, and the like.
