### Quick Recap

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week:

[![Spicy level 4 returns!](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/59878b9c-1917-47f8-bc8a-75e9dec972af.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/9bda6c7b-fe9e-41ca-9da9-e281a4a9889a)
*Spicy level 4 returns!*

This week:

[![Spicy Level 16 Unlocked! ](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a8a26937-18c5-4558-97d4-da2f88ab1cd8.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/9bda6c7b-fe9e-41ca-9da9-e281a4a9889a)
*Spicy Level 16 Unlocked!*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
