<h1>Markets Monday for 2024-07-08</h1>

Analyzing the past and future of the tech market in Markets Monday.<h2>Last week</h2>

Looking at the week behind for the tech market.

I typically ask Siri how NASDAQ is doing and wait to hear it if is a big change or not. Siri logic on the definition of what to say if the there is +/- < 1% seems to be varied by day of attempts. More experimentation or going deeper into how Siri makes word choices will be interesting as the new Apple WWDC stories of Siri evolve over the year.

Previously, I mentioned adding a 5 day view contrasted with a 5 year view.<figure><a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?&window=5D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="5 day view" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/fd2f8e67-3098-4a7d-8514-551b38813fb2.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>5 day view</figcaption></figure>

Last week I made an error by showing only a 1D view vs. a 5D view. This is where automation would be handy so that at least errors would be consistent and correctable for the future.<figure><a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?window=5Y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="5 year view" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/9ad65b31-a574-4feb-ad95-a9a69b7d5c0e.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>5 year view</figcaption></figure>

And again, “this seems to be going up for now”, is still true on a long enough timeline.<h2>This week</h2>

Looking at the week ahead for the tech market.

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.

The winners list last narrowed from five to… two.<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Heat Map view this week" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1c5dfdcf-fcba-4686-af3f-f1987e705359.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>Heat Map view last week</figcaption></figure>

This week an expansion where the two went to fifteen. However, looking back, I made an error last week in going in before the bell. Lesson learned.<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Heat Map view this week" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/cad65354-15f0-4aa8-87d9-a3fdd325ccdd.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>Heat Map view this week</figcaption></figure>
