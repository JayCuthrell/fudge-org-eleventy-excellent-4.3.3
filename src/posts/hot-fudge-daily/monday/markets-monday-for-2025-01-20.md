### Quick Recap

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week:

[![Spicy level 1… and the end of year calm returns.](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/8a1ed8b7-bb6d-4dbf-88c6-350ba113de9b.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
*Spicy level 1… a new year calm returns.*

This week:

> Markets were closed in observance of MLK Day.

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.
