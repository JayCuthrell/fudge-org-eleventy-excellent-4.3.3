For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

This week:<figure><img alt="2 is more than 0" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/9f59fd9d-4b10-4185-9bef-4877d6c949d7.png?w=960&fit=max"/><figcaption>2 is more than 0</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.
