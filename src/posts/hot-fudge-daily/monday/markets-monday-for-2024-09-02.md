<p><em>Today is Labor Day in the United States and markets are closed. Enjoy this free Labor Day edition of Markets Monday.</em></p><p>Happy Labor Day! Labor Day is an important national holiday and important part of the relatively short history of the United States. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.dol.gov/general/laborday/history">https://www.dol.gov/general/laborday/history</a></p><h3>Reading Recommendation</h3><p>The technology market can be hard to keep up with and if you arenâ€™t reading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.thestack.technology/">The Stack</a>, you should be.

During PMI, I discovered that there should have been two (2!) Class B networks conveyed with the acquisition and eventually the acquiring company ended up owning the second Class B too. ðŸ’° </p><p>For perspective, in today's post February 1, 2024 AWS IPv4 address per hour dollars, two (2) Class B would be worth up to <strong><em>~$6M per year</em></strong>. Thatâ€™s a lot of operating capital to set fire to which is perhaps yet another reason to try harder to sunset IPv4 and move to IPv6. ðŸ’¸</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/">https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/</a></p><h3>Quick Recap</h3><p>As a Market Monday reminder and recap, what I try to do each week is look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple yahoo finance webpage. Itâ€™s not much but itâ€™s how I look at things and this is what I saw today after the bell closed.</p><p>Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.</p><p>If you are using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap">Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks</a> screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.</p><ul><li><p>% Change in Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than 4</strong></p></li><li><p>Region:<strong> United States</strong></p></li><li><p>Market Cap (Intraday):<strong> Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap</strong></p></li><li><p>Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than or equal 5</strong></p></li><li><p>Volume:<strong>greater than 15000</strong></p></li><li><p>Sector:<strong> Technology</strong></p></li><li><p>Industry:<strong> Softwareâ€”Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Softwareâ€”Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics &amp; Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific &amp; Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment &amp; Materials and Semiconductors</strong></p></li></ul><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Update: Hereâ€™s what this chart looked like just before building this digest for Sunday September 1, 2025.</p></blockquote><figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/7b3fd1f0-cea0-42f1-b459-3c981f9846a2.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Hot Fudge Daily Monday Markets Heatmap as of Sunday September 1, 2025" draggable="false" contenteditable="false"></a><figcaption>Hot Fudge Daily Monday Markets as of Sunday September 1, 2025</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><p></p>
