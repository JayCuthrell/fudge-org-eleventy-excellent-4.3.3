<em>Today is Labor Day in the United States and markets are closed. Enjoy this free Labor Day edition of Markets Monday.</em>

Happy Labor Day! Labor Day is an important national holiday and important part of the relatively short history of the United States. 🇺🇸

The technology market can be hard to keep up with and if you aren’t reading [The Stack](https://www.thestack.technology/), you should be. As for why, check out this article from [Ed Targett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardtargett/).

Speaking of IPv4 address costs…

My career has seen a lot of post-merger integration work and one instance involved one (1) Class B network. During PMI, I discovered that there should have been two (2!) Class B networks conveyed with the acquisition and eventually the acquiring company ended up owning the second Class B too. 💰 

For perspective, in today's post February 1, 2024 AWS IPv4 address per hour dollars, two (2) Class B would be worth up to <strong><em>~$6M per year</em></strong>. That’s a lot of operating capital to set fire to which is perhaps yet another reason to try harder to sunset IPv4 and move to IPv6. 💸

As a Market Monday reminder and recap, what I try to do each week is look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple yahoo finance webpage. It’s not much but it’s how I look at things and this is what I saw today after the bell closed.

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.
