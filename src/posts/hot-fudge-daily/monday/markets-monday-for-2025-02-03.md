For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week:<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/9bda6c7b-fe9e-41ca-9da9-e281a4a9889a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Nothing burger" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6b71d4b5-bbd0-47bb-966b-befcc7287ad0.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>Well, that’s different.</figcaption></figure>

This week:<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/9bda6c7b-fe9e-41ca-9da9-e281a4a9889a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Spicy level 4 returns!" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/59878b9c-1917-47f8-bc8a-75e9dec972af.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>Spicy level 4 returns!</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.
