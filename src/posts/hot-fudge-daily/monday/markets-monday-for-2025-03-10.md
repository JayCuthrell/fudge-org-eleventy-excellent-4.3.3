For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week:<figure><img alt="Spicy Level 2" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/32aed472-be11-4533-84d4-cc0791509c97.png?w=960&fit=max"/><figcaption>Spicy Level 2.</figcaption></figure>

This week:<figure><img alt="No spicy for you!" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/137d4d8c-319b-4837-8ae1-fbe9680f1a2e.png?w=960&fit=max"/><figcaption>No spicy for you!</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.
