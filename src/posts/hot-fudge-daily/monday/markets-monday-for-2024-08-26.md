According to the tech press, the future of the tech market in Markets Monday will hinge upon NVIDIA earnings on Wednesday August 28, 2024… if you believe the tech press. I kind of don’t but here we go.

As a recap, what I try to do each week is look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple yahoo finance webpage. It’s not much but it’s how I look at things.
