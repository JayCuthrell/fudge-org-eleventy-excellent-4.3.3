As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week:<figure><img alt="Spicy Level 19!" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/863e15f8-24e9-4d9e-91d2-afe42fbb6ad8.png?w=960&fit=max)"/><figcaption>Spicy Level 19!</figcaption></figure>

This week:<figure><img alt="No spicy" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f87dc76c-45c3-4679-9d0b-5f81de15b0f1.png?w=960&fit=max"/><figcaption>No spicy</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.
