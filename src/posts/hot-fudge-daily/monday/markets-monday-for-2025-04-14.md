### Quick Recap

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week:

![Spicy Level 19!](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/863e15f8-24e9-4d9e-91d2-afe42fbb6ad8.png?w=960&fit=max))
*Spicy Level 19!*

This week:

*No spicy*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
