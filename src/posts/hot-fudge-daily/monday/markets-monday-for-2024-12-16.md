For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

This week…<figure><a href="https://fudge.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Not as many green things" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/54b12512-6b18-4b04-923b-d536607da93c.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>Not as many green things</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.
