Analyzing the past and future of the tech market in Markets Monday.<h2>Last week</h2>

As a recap, what I try to do each week is look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple yahoo finance webpage. It’s not much but it’s how I look at things and this is what I saw today after the bell closed.<h2>This week</h2>

Looking at the week ahead for the tech market.

Last week was a bit anemic.<figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="ONTO" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/3cf7c5f7-2d06-459f-acc0-e413d2b56854.png?w=960&fit=max"/></a><figcaption>Heat Map last week</figcaption></figure>

Last week I had a hunch it is because of semiconductors, value chains, and the like. Oh, and [this rise is happeningbeforeearnings on August 8, 2024](https://investors.ontoinnovation.com/news/news-details/2024/Onto-Innovation-to-Report-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results-on-August-8-2024/default.aspx). 🤔

This looks a lot like someone knew something. Maybe?<figure><img alt="$ONTO 5D performance" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a201d8a1-451e-47ab-859f-f195698137bb.png?w=960&fit=max"/><figcaption>$ONTO speculation?</figcaption></figure>

Let’s zoom out a bit. Ah, the rise on the fall of the rise.<figure><img alt="$ONTO 1M performance" contenteditable="false" draggable="false" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/4f39134d-462a-427a-a056-a0a491aafdbd.png?w=960&fit=max"/><figcaption>$ONTO seems normal</figcaption></figure>
