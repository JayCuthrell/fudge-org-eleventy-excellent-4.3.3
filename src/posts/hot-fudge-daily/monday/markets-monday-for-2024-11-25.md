As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week…

[![Once again, many green things continue to appear.](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/12b78f69-f6c7-4924-ac41-69cb2cc43511.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*Green things appeared last week.*

By comparison…

[![Double the green things appeared compared to last week.](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/abf60daa-3273-4075-a837-c9bd8b916928.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap)
*Double the green things appeared this week.*

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.
