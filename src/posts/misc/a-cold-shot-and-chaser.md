Getting Informed
================

Regular readers will recall my *shot and chaser* format from prior issues. Essentially, the format is a callback to prior topics, links, etc. for an issue which is then compared to a more recent or current link for the week.

Thank you for reading Fudge Sunday! Subscribe to get new posts each week:

Why? Previously, I‚Äôve used the *shot and chaser* format to show how the prediction or topic turned out in the market.

But, while my shot and chaser examples often prove to be accurate ‚Äî that‚Äôs not always the case. So, this week we‚Äôre going to look at one prescient and one possibly problematic where I‚Äôve maybe been (comically?) *incredibly inaccurate*. üò¨ü§£

## You showed your appreciation üé∂

I‚Äôm very optimistic about our future [ubiquitous workload substrate](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22ubiquitous+workload+substrate%22).

As a matter of fact, I‚Äôve used the phrase[1](#footnote-1) for ~10 years.[2](#footnote-2) [3](#footnote-3)

Remember‚Ä¶

data centers < information centers < knowledge centers < wisdom centers

### Shot (August 2021)

A year ago my thinking was that the data center being everywhere meant the progress wasn‚Äôt the proliferation of *things* but the proliferation of *means*.

> Beyond data there is a progression to seek meaning as information with a transformation of context into knowledge before it can be applied as wisdom. So, to be clear, up to now we‚Äôve really been talking about data centers not information centers, knowledge centers, let alone wisdom centers.[4](#footnote-4)

### Chaser (July 2022)

Well, here‚Äôs to the journey from from data centers to wisdom centers.

> Databand.ai is IBM's fifth acquisition in 2022 as the company continues to bolster its hybrid cloud and AI skills and capabilities. IBM has [acquired](https://newsroom.ibm.com/mergers-and-acquisitions) more than 25 companies since Arvind Krishna became CEO in April 2020.[5](#footnote-5)

## We'd better learn from that üé∂

Granted, it hasn‚Äôt been even a year, but back in February 2022, I mentioned how blockchain might help empower the proliferation and democratization of 5G infrastructure. I mentioned both FreedomFi and Helium.

### Shot (February 2022)

I made note of FreedomFi and Helium‚Ä¶ but my confidence level was hedged somewhere between intrigue and ngmi.[6](#footnote-6)

### Chaser (July 2022)

Again, it‚Äôs only been a few months but‚Ä¶ this Twitter thread is a sober, fair, if not brutal pushback on the ‚ÄúWeb3 solves this‚Äù shilling meme. So, let‚Äôs see how it shakes out in 2.5 years?

Liron Shapira @liron.@helium, often cited as one of the best examples of a Web3 use case, has received $365M of investment led by @a16z.

Regular folks have also been convinced to spend $250M buying hotspot nodes, in hopes of earning passive income.

The result? Helium's total revenue is $6.5k/month ![Image](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)![Image](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)![Image](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)![Image](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)](<https://twitter.com/liron/status/1551738599254773765?s=20&t=Gw745mz2_mg_Sr7nEHfKlA)[1:18> AM ‚àô Jul 26, 2022

15,172Likes2,171Retweets](<https://twitter.com/liron/status/1551738599254773765?s=20&t=Gw745mz2_mg_Sr7nEHfKlA>) But wait‚Ä¶ there was even a Planet Money podcast reference to Helium as well.

And then there is this recent query of Techmeme coverage[7](#footnote-7) that puts the recent months story arc of Helium / Nova Labs into sobering perspective

(https://techmeme.com/search/query?q=helium&wm=false)And yet‚Ä¶ am or will I be both wrong and right at the same time?

It turns out that Nova Labs has [checks notes] acquired FreedomFi.[8](#footnote-8)
