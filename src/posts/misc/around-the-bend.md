The Asteroids Galaxy Tour - Around The Bend (2009)

*Note: This issue marks a successful migration from Revue (Twitter) to Substack.*

# Getting Informed

First, you might recall my shot and chaser format from prior issues. Essentially, I call back to a prior reference in an issue with a current link to how the prediction or topic turned out in the market.

### **[Shot: Cheap as Chips (December 2021)](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-sunday-cheap-as-chips-in-2022-946008?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)**

One of my predictions was our pandemic related so-called ‚Äúchip crisis‚Äù would ultimately lead to a future state of increased supply of drastically lower price chips in far more devices and use cases. So, as of last week, the future is already starting to look closer than I imagined.

*The global semiconductor shortage that‚Äôs bogged down the auto industry for almost two years is showing signs of easing, at least for now.*

# I'll stay forever with you üé∂**

While this next shot and chaser is not a part of my newsletter history, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that the future got here faster than I personally thought. Indeed, I remember buying engraved üì± devices as loving mementos just over a decade ago and in the years since.

The song ‚ÄòAround the Bend‚Äô by The Asteroids Galaxy Tour appeared as the backing track for the iPod Touch commercials that became so iconic as Apple began to explore the adjacencies in their growing handheld device market.

# Update

And speaking of staying forever‚Ä¶ farewell to Revue‚Ä¶ and hello (for now) to Substack.

It appears that Substack will happily digest things from Revue via RSS full feed import but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just learning this now and expect there are caveats.

For example‚Ä¶ I had multiple ‚Äúnull‚Äù import results which required deleting and running import again. The ‚Äúnull‚Äù requiring a manual delete step is probably due to a considerate no-clobbering feature for overwriting a successful slug even if it is empty.

I‚Äôll have to dig into the /*issues*/ vs. /*p*/ URI difference implications but I like that the slug looks so similar and that Substack appears to be doing the HTTP redirect so that /*issues*/ and /*p*/ are resolved automatically.

Also, each of my YouTube links for song inclusions as the inspiration for an issue appear to get malformed in the migration. So, I‚Äôll be doing 40+ manual edits or so but in the meantime, I‚Äôve created a playlist which I‚Äôll update along the way:

Planning ahead, I‚Äôm going to go belt (mirroring) and suspenders (substack) for a while and start reading up on self-hosted options (again). I mean, if Substack experiences a [change in control](https://sunday.fudge.org/p/fudge-sunday-moving-out-1200494) too, I‚Äôd much prefer to avoid this research topic again.

We shall see‚Ä¶ but so far so good if you are reading this issue. [1](#footnote-1)

## Just for fun

I‚Äôve been noodling again in the home studio. Riffs and jingles as always.

Publishing from GarageBand directly to SoundCloud helps keep the earworm at bay.
