This week we take a look at hype and the loop of technology journalism.

 **Getting Informed**

Let’s start with a perspective from 10 years ago. The year was 2012.

(https://fudge.org/archive/tech-journalism?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)**

2012 was a big year for technology companies. Specifically, 2012 was a year of legal disputes, interoperability loss, M&A activity, IPO activities, and FAANG was born.

At the same time, coverage of technology companies was changing into an endless loop of hot takes and narrowing sources. Technology journalism had become [a seemingly endless loop](https://fudge.org/archive/tech-journalism?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) of horse race metaphors, hyperbole, and all while avoiding external links to sources in pursuit of capturing more eyeballs.

For example, the loop somehow lost interest in streaming the [Perseverance Rover’s Descent and Touchdown on Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=4czjS9h4Fpg). Instead, the coverage lended itself to curious references to product placement for [Amazon](https://www.techmeme.com/120811/p1?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a120811p1), [Apple](https://www.techmeme.com/120806/p67?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a120806p67), and cord-cutting services like [Ustream](https://www.techmeme.com/120808/p44?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a120808p44).

In terms of meta coverage, the sources that were prolific in 2012 is worth noting from [Techmeme leaderboard (2012)](https://web.archive.org/web/20121225113056/https://www.techmeme.com/lb?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

Now, cut to the present day. What has changed?

Readers of technology journalism have access to a growing number of resources and influences that represent new perspectives. For starters, there is a greater appreciation by the readers of technology journalism for original sources, data driven journalism, and native advertising.

This reflects on the current [Techmeme leaderboard](https://www.techmeme.com/lb?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) as well.

So how are we doing with respect to the *hype* of 2012?

For 2012, Gartner called plateaus of productivity for several blue dots and gold triangles to represent 5-10 years and +10 years respectively.

Now, cut to the present day. What has changed?

Two things.

1. Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies is more conservative.
2. Newsletters. Newsletters. Newsletters.

There is [a whole lot of nothing on the right side](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-08-23-gartner-identifies-key-emerging-technologies-spurring-innovation-through-trust-growth-and-change?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to represent [disillusioned, enlightened, and productive](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3887767/understanding-gartner-s-hype-cycles?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). Tune in again over the next ~10 years perhaps? 🤔
