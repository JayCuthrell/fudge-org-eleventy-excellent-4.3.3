📈 Sovereign satellites are a growing trend as more countries want to head to the high ground of space.

💰🛰️🚀 US Space Development Agency placed [$3.5B worth of orders  for building missile warning, tracking, and defense (MWTD) space vehicles (SVs)](https://www.sda.mil/space-development-agency-makes-awards-to-build-72-tracking-layer-satellites-for-tranche-3/) with Lockheed Martin, [Rocket Lab USA](https://www.rocketlabusa.com), Northrop Grumman, and L3Harris Technologies.

🇰🇷🚀🛰️ South Korea's [Innospace](https://www.innospc.com) had their first [HANBIT-Nano orbital launch postponed](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7407930201038417920/) in Brazil and it is being rescheduled

👀 Two more updates caught my eye involving the competition within established solutions and the disruption of astronomy itself.
