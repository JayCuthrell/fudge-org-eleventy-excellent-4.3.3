In the quaint olden days of 2011, [cyber warfare risk was compared to solar flare risk](https://www.techmeme.com/110117/p50#a110117p50). But, how to predict or better yet how to expect?

We will come back to cyber warfare as the new kinetic field of space enables the new cybernetic spatial surface. For now, let's focus on solar flares and solar wind.

It is easy to take terrestrial weather reporting for granted, even locally. But, when solar activity occurs, that's when the "fudge factor" is even more important to out-design for what you cannot outrun or avoid as [a survival buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening) during these events.

Recently, [NASA and IBM released a model trained on solar data](https://www.techmeme.com/250820/p47#a250820p47). It is reasonable to expect a "[space weather report](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/)" ([and others](https://swe.ssa.esa.int/)) to become essential as [solar powered orbital datacenters](https://fudge.org/archive/solar-powered-orbital-datacenters/) are put into service.

So, it you consider the utility value of the half-dozen space weather reports, it is also useful to consider which commercial entities will become patrons or merely benefit from publicly funded sourcing and presentation of data. To achieve scale, there will need to be a clear anticipation for the commercialization analogy of the alleged AccuWeather and National Weather Service (NWS) terrestrial weather data licensing and distribution imbroglio.
