If you are into New Year resolutions, are you going to update your Successor settings?

My early career in telecom and INFOSEC taught me painful but valuable lessons about documentation and effective succession planning. Those experiences shaped my view that knowledge sharing and continuity are non-negotiable.

With that in mind: If you use a source code repository, what happens if you can no longer maintain it?

I only recently noticed [a new setting made available in GitHub specifically for this][10]. It’s worth a look.

However, depending on your trust in the longevity of any single organization, a POSSE (Publish on Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) approach might make more sense. I’m seeing more developers replicating or migrating entirely to alternatives to ensure redundancy.

YMMV, but if you are looking to adopt a "cockroach strategy" for your code, here are a few alternatives to consider:

* The Archives: [Software Heritage][1]
* The Community Hosts: [Codeberg][4], [Forgejo][3], [SourceHut][7]

I'll leave out the discussion on the implications of AI "hoovering up" POSSE source code for now (legally murky at best ⚖️). This is strictly about succession planning and documentation. 🤓

Do you foresee your repos being placed in cislunar space? On the Moon? On Mars? Or beyond?
