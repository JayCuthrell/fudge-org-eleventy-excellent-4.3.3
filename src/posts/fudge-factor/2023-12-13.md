We have moved past the "is this possible?" phase of orbital datacenters.

We now proceed to "what is permissible" phase.

While terrestrial datacenters are sweating over power purchase agreements and grid constraints, a new consensus is forming 62 miles over our heads beyond the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line). The narrative has shifted from pure science fiction to a necessity driven by the brutal math of AI energy consumption.

The loudest signal so far is [Aetherflux putting a due date on the calendar for its first commercial orbital datacenter node in Q1 2027](https://www.networkworld.com/article/4105311/aetherflux-joins-the-race-to-launch-orbital-data-centers-by-2027.html). Start the countdown.

The "Fudge Factor" in play will seek to bypass the lead times for terrestrial utility connections and deploy reliable, solar-dense compute in orbit. Demonstrating power beaming is a bold bet that disposable, high-cadence satellite launches can outpace the sluggish timelines of Earth-based infrastructure.

If you watched [Gavin Baker articulate the case for space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmUo4841KQw&t=3120s), the first principles are clear:

* Solar is ~30% more intense than on Earth, with up to 6x the effective irradiance due to 24/7 exposure
* You don't need massive battery arrays if the sun never sets
* Radiators facing deep space offer a heat sink near absolute zero—effectively free cooling
* Light travels roughly 30% faster in the vacuum of space than in fiber optics

Meanwhile, academia is providing the rigorous framework to back these claims, with recent papers in [Nature Electronics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-025-01476-1) validating the thermal and energy models of space-based edge computing. So, the race is on as well as the race for launch capacity (i.e. Starship and New Glenn), we have the thermal modeling, and now, we have the launch dates.

Keep an eye on the launch cost in terms of cost per unit of weight. As that metric drops, things get even more interesting. Along the way, keep an eye on these market players:
