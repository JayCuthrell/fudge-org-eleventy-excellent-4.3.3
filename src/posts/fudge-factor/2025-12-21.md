### 🛰️ Launches and Funding

* 🇯🇵 [Rocket Lab](https://www.rocketlabusa.com) completed its 21st successful Electron mission for 2025, "[The Wisdom God Guides](https://x.com/RocketLab/status/2002624814230671524)," deploying the QPS-SAR-15 satellite for [iQPS](https://i-qps.net). By maintaining [100% mission success rate for the year](https://rocketlabcorp.com/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-for-iqps-ends-2025-with-21-launches-and-100-mission-succes/), the market seems to be pleased with [RKLB](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/RKLB:NASDAQ?window=MAX).
* 🇮🇳 [Digantara](https://www.digantara.co.in) raised [$50M Series-B](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/indias-digantara-raises-50m-for-space-based-missile-defence-tech/) to fund the deployment of its 15-satellite SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking) surveillance constellation and ALBATROSS (missile-warning) satellites, which aim to provide near-real-time threat detection.

### 📚 A Growing List of of Space Value Chain (SVC) Companies

I've been thinking about the growing list of space value chain (SVC) companies. But how to visualize that market landscape?

For now, I've decide on [https://github.com/cncf/landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) and checked in a mostly working version: [https://github.com/JayCuthrell/svc.fudge.org](https://github.com/JayCuthrell/svc.fudge.org)

The result? [Space Value Chain (SVC) Landscape](https://svc.fudge.org) 🤓 The GitHub Actions build process even generates a [landscape.png](https://svc.fudge.org/docs/landscape.png) and [landscape.pdf](https://svc.fudge.org/docs/landscape.pdf). Pull requests [welcomed](https://github.com/JayCuthrell/svc.fudge.org/pulls)! I'm not sure I can justify a paid [Crunchbase API license](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/using-the-api) but that would be fun to try out for a while.
