We're heading towards [autonomous BiO-sanitation Battalion (BOB) robots cleaning up trash in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Hole_(1979_film)) that won't need anyone on the ground back on Earth to pilot or direct their mission. Disney movie references aside, the first "BOB" robots are more likely to be covered in NASCAR-style logos and be streamed on YouTube with interstitial advertising and curated vignettes shared on [/r/oddlysatisfying](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/).

Meanwhile, orbital datacenters should provide a path to reducing [ground-in-the-loop](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?&title=Precise%20Ground-In-the-Loop%20Orbit%20Control%20for%20Low%20Earth%20Observation%20Satellites&publication_year=2004&author=Arbinger%2CC.&author=D%E2%80%99Amico%2CS.&author=Eineder%2CM.) computational demands and associated latency.

Historically, precise spacecraft trajectory generation has been a significant operational bottleneck, heavily dependent on resource-intensive ground teams because onboard flight computers lacked the processing power to solve complex non-linear navigation problems in real-time. That operational bottleneck may be removed as more advances come to edge computing and machine learning models suited to enable more autonomous operations.

[Deep Learning Warm Starts for Trajectory Optimization on the International Space Station](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05588) is recent a paper that delivers a pivotal operational breakthrough that enabled the [ISS Astrobee](https://www.nasa.gov/astrobee/) robot to generate safe, optimal flight paths autonomously by reducing onboard computational iterations. This research advances the Technology Readiness Level ([TRL](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/)) for autonomous systems, providing a path to a more scalable architecture necessary for upcoming [cislunar](https://www.jhuapl.edu/work/expertise/cislunar-science-and-technology) and in-space servicing missions to operate independently of ground control, reducing mission costs and mitigating communication latency risks in deep(er) space.
