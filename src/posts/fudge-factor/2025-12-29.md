What if space habitats of the future involved less part by part assembly launches and were more commonly expanded like a balloon after a single launch? 🎈

### 🚀🔭🛰️🧑‍🚀🎈 Space Value Chain (SVC) Related and Inflated

* First, check out the Max Space's [Thunderbird Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNf1i3gltnY) design which is [using inflatable fabric-based designs instead of steel](https://aluula.com/commercial/) for rapidly deployment from a single launch at low cost per cubic meter.
* Next, check out Sierra Space's [Large Integrated Flexible Environment (LIFE) habitat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_6-1D1-jec) design being [certification tested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmmpQLqT4gc).
* Finally (for now at least), check out Lockheed Martin's [Inflatable Habitat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzM8OMf49SE) design.

Keep an eye on updates regarding debris and life support systems testing in this... *expanding* market.
