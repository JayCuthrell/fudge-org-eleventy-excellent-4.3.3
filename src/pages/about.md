[fudge.org](/) has been many things over the years as an archive of writing from [Jay Cuthrell](https://jaycuthrell.com) since the late 1990s and his newsletters [Fudge Factor 🤔💡🤯🤓](/) and [🌶️ Hot Fudge Daily](https://hot.fudge.org).

The latest version of [fudge.org](/) based on an amazing starter called [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) by [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/).
